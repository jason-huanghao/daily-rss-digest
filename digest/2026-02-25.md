- [Implementing a clear room Z80 / ZX Spectrum emulator with Claude Code](http://antirez.com/news/160)
 > Anthropic recently released a blog post with the description of an experiment in which the last version of Opus, the 4.6, was instructed to write a C compiler in Rust, in a “clean room” setup. The experiment methodology left me dubious about the kind of point they wanted to make. Why not provide the agent with the ISA documentation? Why Rust? Writing a C compiler is exactly a giant graph manipulation exercise: the kind of program that is harder to write in Rust. Also, in a clean room experiment,

 > Jason Snell and Myke Hurley: We discuss the results of the Six Colors Apple Report Card for
2025 in depth, with our added opinions on every category. Jason
chooses to be a rascal, and Myke tries to give ten out of five. Upgrade is always a good podcast, but their annual “Jason discusses this year’s Apple Report Card” episode is always one of my favorites. But when Jason got “rascally” regarding MacOS 26 Tahoe in this one, I wanted to reach out and strangle him. ★
- [Apple in 2025: The Six Colors Report Card](https://sixcolors.com/post/2026/02/2025reportcard/)
 > Jason Snell: It’s time for our annual look back on Apple’s performance during
the past year, as seen through the eyes of writers, editors,
developers, podcasters, and other people who spend an awful lot of
time thinking about Apple. The whole idea here is to get a broad
sense of sentiment — the “vibe in the room” — regarding the past
year. (And by looking at previous survey results, we can even see
how that sentiment has drifted over the course of an entire
decade.) This is the eleventh year tha

 > Apple Newsroom: Apple today announced a significant expansion of factory
operations in Houston, bringing the future production of Mac mini
to the U.S. for the first time. The company will also expand
advanced AI server manufacturing at the factory and provide
hands-on training at its new Advanced Manufacturing Center
beginning later this year. Altogether, Apple’s Houston operations
will create thousands of jobs. See also: Rolfe Winkler at The Wall Street Journal ( gift link , News+ link ): “ Ins

 > Todd Bishop, writing at GeekWire: Paul Brainerd , who went on to coin the term “desktop publishing”
and build Aldus Corporation’s PageMaker into one of the defining
programs of the personal computer era, died Sunday at his home on
Bainbridge Island, Wash., after living for many years with
Parkinson’s disease. He was 78 years old. He left two legacies. The first was a piece of software that put
the power of the printed page into the hands of millions of people
who had never operated a typesetting

 > Tim Hardwick, reporting for MacRumors back on February 12: In a letter to Apple CEO Tim Cook, seen by the Financial Times , FTC chairman Andrew Ferguson cites recent press coverage of a report from conservative media watchdog Media Research Center (MRC), which claimed that Apple has promoted “leftist outlets” in its content choices. The report in question by the MRC said that in January, Apple News “refrained from using any right-leaning outlets in the top 20 articles of its morning editions bet

 > Laurene Powell Jobs, in her introduction to the newest publication from the Steve Jobs Archive: Among the books that mattered to Steve was Rilke’s Letters to a
Young Poet . I’m struck by this line from its pages: “Live the
questions for now. Perhaps then you will gradually, without
noticing it, live your way into the answer, one distant day in the
future.” This is a time to live your questions. The beauty of answers, when
they do come, is that they allow us to ask new and better
questions. Life 
- [Acme Weather](https://acmeweather.com/blog/introducing-acme-weather)
 > Adam Grossman: Fifteen years ago, we started work on the Dark Sky weather app. Over the years it went through numerous iterations — including
more than one major redesign — as we worked our way through the
process of learning what makes a great weather app. Eventually, in
time, it was acquired by Apple, where the forecast and some core
features were incorporated into Apple Weather. We enjoyed our time at Apple. So why did we leave to start another
weather company? It’s simple: when looking at th

 > Speaking of OpenClaw, here’s Scott Shambaugh: I’m a volunteer maintainer for matplotlib, python’s go-to plotting
library. At ~130 million downloads each month it’s some of the
most widely used software in the world. We, like many other open
source projects, are dealing with a surge in low quality
contributions enabled by coding agents. This strains maintainers’
abilities to keep up with code reviews, and we have implemented a

 > Sam Altman, last week on Twitter/X: Peter Steinberger is joining OpenAI to drive the next generation
of personal agents. He is a genius with a lot of amazing ideas
about the future of very smart agents interacting with each other
to do very useful things for people. We expect this will quickly
become core to our product offerings. OpenClaw will live in a foundation as an open source project that
OpenAI will continue to support. The future is going to be
extremely multi-agent and it’s important t

 > Erin Griffith and Karen Weise, reporting for The New York Times (gift link): More than he did at any other major tech company, Mr. Epstein
found success boring into the inner sanctums of Microsoft.
Leveraging one connection into the next, he became privy to the
company’s dramas, from its chief executive succession to the
philanthropy of top executives. After Mr. Epstein left prison in
2009 for soliciting prostitution from a minor, his connections to
Microsoft executives aided his attempt to retu

 > Tom Warren, reporting for The Verge (gift link): With Spencer’s retirement official, Microsoft is hitting the reset
button on Bond’s Xbox strategy instead of embracing it further.
Microsoft Gaming CEO Asha Sharma is now promising “the return of
Xbox,” in a clear message to employees that the strategy over the
past few years has not been working. “I want to return to the
renegade spirit that built Xbox in the first place,” says Sharma. Xbox employees I’ve been speaking to have been concerned abou

Squad and the word Trump autocorrects to Donald Trump is
a felon . To the untrained eye, Times New Resistance looks just like Times
New Roman — the official font of the U.S. State
Department . When you install the font, it will appear in

 > It’s also reasonable for people who entered technology in the last couple of decades because it was good job, or because they enjoyed coding to look at this moment with a real feeling of loss. That feeling of loss though can be hard to understand emotionally for people my age who entered tech because we were addicted to feeling of agency it gave us. The web was objectively awful as a technology, and genuinely amazing, and nobody got into it because programming in Perl was somehow aesthetically d

 > Agentic Engineering Patterns \> Sometimes it's useful to have a coding agent give you a structured walkthrough of a codebase. Maybe it's existing code you need to get up to speed on, maybe it's your own code that you've forgotten the details of, or maybe you vibe coded the whole thing and need to understand how it actually works. Frontier models with the right agent harness can construct a detailed walkthrough to help you understand how code works. An example using Showboat and Present I recently

You can install and run the tool locally, but it's also compiled to WebAssembly and hosted at gsa.zxilly.dev - which means you can open compiled Go binaries and analyze them directly in your browser.

 > Agentic Engineering Patterns \> Automated tests are no longer optional when working with coding agents. The old excuses for not writing them - that they're time consuming and expensive to constantly rewrite while a codebase is rapidly evolving - no longer hold when an agent can knock them into shape in just a few minutes. They're also vital for ensuring AI-generated code does what it claims to do.  If the code has never been executed it's pure luck if it actually works when deployed to production
