- [Taking action against AI harms](https://anildash.com/2026/02/23/taking-action-ai-harms/)
 > In my last piece, I talked about the harms that AI is visiting on children through the irresponsible choices made by the platforms creating those products. While we dove a bit into the incentives and institutional pressures that cause those companies to make such wildly irresponsible decisions, what we haven’t yet reckoned with is how we hold these companies accountable. Often, people tell me they feel overwhelmed at the idea of trying to engage with getting laws passed, or fighting a big politi

- [Making Icon Sets Easy With Web Origami](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2026/origami-icons/)
 > Over the years, I’ve used different icon sets on my blog. Right now I use Heroicons . The recommended way to use them is to copy/paste the source from the website directly into your HTML. It’s a pretty straightforward process: Go to the website Search for the icon you want Hover it Click to “Copy SVG” Go back to your IDE and paste it If you’re using React or Vue, there are also npm packages you can install so you can import the icons as components. But I’m not using either of those frameworks, s

- [New Blog Post: Some Silly Z3 Scripts I Wrote](https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/archive/new-blog-post-some-silly-z3-scripts-i-wrote/)
 > Now that I'm not spending all my time on Logic for Programmers, I have time to update my website again! So here's the first blog post in five months: Some Silly Z3 Scripts I Wrote . Normally I'd also put a link to the Patreon notes but I've decided I don't like publishing gated content and am going to wind that whole thing down. So some quick notes about this post: Part of the point is admittedly to hype up the eventual release of LfP. I want to start marketing the book, but don't want the marke

 > Norbert Heger: In the release notes for macOS 26.3 RC, Apple stated that the
window-resizing issue I demonstrated in my recent blog
post had been resolved. You’ll never guess what happened between the RC (release candidate) version and the actual shipping version of 26.3. Just kidding, you’ll guess. ★
- [NetNewsWire 7 for Mac](https://netnewswire.blog/2026/01/27/netnewswire-for-mac.html)
 > Brent Simmons, last month: The big change from 6.2.1 is that it adopts the Liquid Glass UI
and it requires macOS 26. (Note to people who aren’t on macOS 26: we fixed a lot of bugs in
6.2 and 6.2.1 knowing that many people might skip, or at least
delay, installing macOS 26. Also note that there’s a page where
you can get old versions of NetNewsWire .) It feels a little weird for me not to be running the latest version of NetNewsWire, but since I’m skipping MacOS 26 Tahoe, I can’t run NetNewsWire

 > Trader Joe’s: Like their milk chocolate brethren on our shelves, our Dark
Chocolate Peanut Butter Cups are made with real peanut butter
that’s made with slowly roasted and ground Virginia peanuts. The
luscious, smooth, rich, dark chocolate enveloping that peanut
butter is crafted from high quality cacao beans. Other purveyors
of peanut butter cups fill theirs with all kinds of “extraneous”
ingredients. Ours are free of such things. We eschew artificial
flavors and preservatives, as well as color

 > Brad Reese, on LinkedIn last week : My grandfather, H. B. Reese (Who Invented Reese’s), built Reese’s
on a simple, enduring architecture: Milk Chocolate + Peanut
Butter. Not a flavor idea. Not a marketing construct. A real,
tangible product identity that consumers have trusted for a
century. But today, Reese’s identity is being rewritten, not by
storytellers, but by formulation decisions that replace Milk
Chocolate with compound coatings and Peanut Butter with
peanut‑butter‑style crèmes across m

Somehow, every time I get to that LinkedIn tab, I pause for a second. I just have to click on the little red dot in the top right corner, see that there is nothing new, then resume my clicking. Why is that? Why can't I ignore the red notification badge? When you sign up for LinkedIn for the first time, it's right there. A little red dot in the top r

I suppose this is not uncommon, but I’m not a lawyer, so I don’t have that much experience comparing laws. I do, however, consult for lawyers and have to look […] The post Copy and paste law first appeared on John D. Cook .

 > John Coltrane’s song Giant Steps is known for its unusual and difficult chord changes. Although the chord progressions are complicated, there aren’t that many unique chords, only nine. And there is a simple pattern to the chords; the difficulty comes from the giant steps between the chords. If you wrap the chromatic scale around a […] The post Giant Steps first appeared on John D.

 > This book doesn't know what it wants to be. Is it a sociology textbook, travel guide, history book, or guide to the mysteries of the world? Subtitled "the temporal misadventures of a social psychologist" it veers between hard data and well-worn anecdotes until it becomes a sort of self-help book for the time-poor 1990s American executive.  Despite being well-caveated against the "dangers in…

 > Ladybird adopts Rust, with help from AI Really interesting case-study from Andreas Kling on advanced, sophisticated use of coding agents for ambitious coding projects with critical code. After a few years hoping Swift's platform support outside of the Apple ecosystem would mature they switched tracks to Rust their memory-safe language of choice, starting with an AI-assisted port of a critical library: Our first target was LibJS , Ladybird's JavaScript engine.

 > I've started a new project to collect and document Agentic Engineering Patterns - coding practices and patterns to help get the best results out of this new era of coding agent development we find ourselves entering. I'm using Agentic Engineering to refer to building software using coding agents - tools like Claude Code and OpenAI Codex, where the defining feature is that they can both generate and execute code - allowing them to test that code and iterate on it independently of turn-by-turn gui
- [Writing code is cheap now](https://simonwillison.net/guides/agentic-engineering-patterns/code-is-cheap/#atom-everything)
 > Agentic Engineering Patterns \> The biggest challenge in adopting agentic engineering practices is getting comfortable with the consequences of the fact that writing code is cheap now . Code has always been expensive. Producing a few hundred lines of clean, tested code takes most software developers a full day or more. Many of our engineering habits, at both the macro and micro level, are built around this core constraint. At the macro level we spend a great deal of time designing, estimating and

 > The paper asked me to explain vibe coding, and I did so, because I think something big is coming there, and I'm deep in, and I worry that normal people are not able to see it and I want them to be prepared. But people can't just read something and hate you quietly; they can't see that you have provided them with a utility or a warning; they need their screech. You are distributed to millions of people, and become the local proxy for the emotions of maybe dozens of people, who disagree and demand

 > Nothing humbles you like telling your OpenClaw “confirm before acting” and watching it speedrun deleting your inbox. I couldn’t stop it from my phone. I had to RUN to my Mac mini like I was defusing a bomb. I said “Check this inbox too and suggest what you would archive or delete, don’t action until I tell you to.” This has been working well for my toy inbox, but my real inbox was too huge and triggered compaction. During the compaction, it lost my original instruction 🤦‍♀️ — Summer Yue Tags: ai
