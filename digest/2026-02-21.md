 > The original Legend of Zelda came out 40 years ago today. With other birthdays on the horizon, like Twilight Princess ’s 20th in November, I wanted a calendar that showed the anniversary of every Zelda game. So I made one. Subscribe to this URL in your calendar app: https://evanhahn.com/tape/zelda_anniversaries.ics Once you do, you’ll get calendar events on the anniversary of each game’s release. For example, you’ll be able to see that the Oracle games turn 25 in less than a week…I feel old. If

 > I’ve written before about computing big Fibonacci numbers, and about creating a certificate to verify a Fibonacci number has been calculated correctly. This post will revisit both, giving a different approach to computing big Fibonacci numbers that produces a certificate along the way. As I’ve said before, I’m not aware of any practical reason to […] The post Computing big, certified Fibonacci numbers first appeared on John D. Cook .

 > At the recent FOSDEM, I did a very quick lightning talk about our OpenBenches project.  Sadly, despite the best efforts of the AV team, the video had a missing section. I took my own audio recording and zipkid took some photos, so I was able to recreate it using the Flowblade video editor.  Enjoy!    Many thanks to Edward Betts for running the dev room and providing the display laptop. …

- [Andrej Karpathy talks about "Claws"](https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/21/claws/#atom-everything)
 > Andrej Karpathy talks about "Claws" Andrej Karpathy tweeted a mini-essay about buying a Mac Mini ("The apple store person told me they are selling like hotcakes and everyone is confused") to tinker with Claws: I'm definitely a bit sus'd to run OpenClaw specifically [...] But I do love the concept and I think that just like LLM agents were a new layer on top of LLMs, Claws are now a new layer on top of LLM agents, taking the orchestration, scheduling, context, tool calls and a kind of persistence
- [Adding TILs, releases, museums, tools and research to my blog](https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/20/beats/#atom-everything)
 > I've been wanting to add indications of my various other online activities to my blog for a while now. I just turned on a new feature I'm calling "beats" (after story beats, naming this was hard!) which adds five new types of content to my site, all corresponding to activity elsewhere. Here's what beats look like: Those three are from the 30th December 2025 archive page. Beats are little inline links with badges that fit into different content timeline views around my site, including the homepag

 > Taalas serves Llama 3.1 8B at 17,000 tokens/second This new Canadian hardware startup just announced their first product - a custom hardware implementation of the Llama 3.1 8B model (from July 2024 ) that can run at a staggering 17,000 tokens/second. I was going to include a video of their demo but it's so fast it would look more like a screenshot. You can try it out at chatjimmy.ai . They describe their Silicon Llama as “aggressively quantized, combining 3-bit and 6-bit parameters.” Their next

- [Consider mentioning your little personal scripts to your co-workers](https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/sysadmin/MentionLittleScripts)
 > I have a habit of writing little scripts at work for my own use
(perhaps like some number of my readers). They pile up like snowdrifts
in my $HOME/adm, except they don't melt away when their time is
done but stick around even when they're years obsolete. Every so
often I mention one of them to my co-workers; sometimes my co-workers
aren't interested, but sometimes they find the script appealing and
have me put it into our shared location for 'production' scripts
and programs. Sometimes, these pr
