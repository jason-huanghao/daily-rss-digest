 > Many of the topics that we’ve all been discussing about technology these days seem to matter so much more, and the stakes have never been higher. So, I’ve been trying to engage with more conversations out in the world, in hopes of communicating some of the ideas that might not get shared from more traditional voices in technology. These recent conversations have been pretty well received, and I hope you’ll take a minute to give them a listen when you have a moment. Galaxy Brain First, it was nic

 > Terry Godier, in a thoughtful essay on the design of RSS feed readers: There’s a particular kind of guilt that visits me when I open my
feed reader after a few days away. It’s not the guilt of having
done something wrong, exactly. It’s more like the feeling of
walking into a room where people have been waiting for you, except
when you look around, the room is empty. There’s no one there.
There never was. I’ve been thinking about this feeling for a long time. Longer
than I probably should, given

 > Emily Glazer, reporting for The Wall Street Journal: The billionaire said he met with Epstein starting in 2011, years
after Epstein had pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting a minor for
prostitution. Gates said he was aware of some “18-month thing”
that had limited Epstein’s travel but said he didn’t properly
check his background. Gates said he continued meeting with Epstein
even after his then-wife Melinda French Gates expressed concerns
in 2013. “Knowing what I know now makes it, you know, a hu

 > Greg Knauss: People will argue that speaking English to LLMs is just another
level of abstraction away from the physics of how the machine actually works. And while that’s technically true — the worst
kind of true — it also misses the point. Industrialization
fundamentally changes things, by quantum degrees. A Ding Dong from
a factory is not the same thing as a gâteau au chocolat et crème
chantilly from a baker which is not the same thing as cramming
chunks of chocolate and scoops of whipped cre

 > Ben Schoon, writing for 9to5 Google: When activated, Privacy Display changes how the pixels in your
display emit light, making it harder or near-impossible to view
the display at an off-angle. At its default setting, it definitely
works, but the contents of the display are visible at less-sharp
angles. Samsung has a “maximum” setting that takes this up a
notch, and that setting makes it even harder to see the contents
and narrows the field-of-view even further. [...] A bigger deal, though, is th

 > Jim Vorel, writing just yesterday for Jezebel: It can be hard to know what exactly to call the substances that
are now found coating many major candy bars such as Butterfinger,
Baby Ruth, Almond Joy, Mr. Goodbar or Rolos. Food scientists refer
to it as “compound chocolate” coating, because it’s made from
actual cocoa powder, but replaces the more expensive source of fat
(cocoa butter) with cheaper, lower-quality vegetable fats. When
Hershey brands such as Mr. Goodbar or Almond Joy made the switc

 > After writing a few days ago about the current brouhaha over the severe decline in the edibility of Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups , and linking to Trader Joe’s shade-throwing description of their own , I of course had to try theirs. In the name of science, I bought both the milk and dark chocolate variants. Verdict: Excellent. Both chocolates taste like chocolate, not candle wax, and the peanut butter is creamy and smooth — you know, like peanut butter. Not the sand-and-sawdust mix that Hershey fil

 > Over the past fifty years, the U.S. economy built a giant rent-extraction layer on top of human limitations: things take time, patience runs out, brand familiarity substitutes for diligence, and most people are willing to accept a bad price to avoid more clicks. Trillions of dollars of enterprise value depended on those constraints persisting. – Citrini Research

What would you do if your passengers were killed - not by a terrifying alien, but by Count Dracula???  What if, on the return journey, another set of your passengers were similarly slaughtered.

 > Google API Keys Weren't Secrets. But then Gemini Changed the Rules. Yikes! It turns out Gemini and Google Maps (and other services) share the same API keys... but Google Maps API keys are designed to be public, since they are embedded directly in web pages. Gemini API keys can be used to access private files and make billable API requests, so they absolutely should not be shared. If you don't understand this it's very easy to accidentally enable Gemini billing on a previously public API key that

 > If people are only using this a couple of times a week at most, and can’t think of anything to do with it on the average day, it hasn’t changed their life. OpenAI itself admits the problem, talking about a ‘capability gap’ between what the models can do and what people do with them, which seems to me like a way to avoid saying that you don’t have clear product-market fit. Hence, OpenAI’s ad project is partly just about covering the cost of serving the 90% or more of users who don’t pay (and capt

 > tldraw issue: Move tests to closed source repo It's become very apparent over the past few months that a comprehensive test suite is enough to build a completely fresh implementation of any open source library from scratch, potentially in a different language. This has worrying implications for open source projects with commercial business models. Here's an example of a response: tldraw, the outstanding collaborative drawing library (see previous coverage ), are moving their test suite to a priv

It's a little bit janky right now. Initially when I tried it I got the error "Remote Control is not enabled for your account. Contact your administrator."

I grabbed a slot for a talk I titled "The State of LLMs, February 2026 edition", subtitle "It's all changed since November!". I vibe coded a custom macOS app for the presentation the night before.
