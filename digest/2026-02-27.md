 > Soms denk je, kan het nog gekker? We gaan het beheer van het platform waarop DigiD draait overlaten aan een Amerikaans bedrijf. Dit was niet de bedoeling, maar het gebeurt nu toch.
Maar het blijkt dat het nog erger kan. DigiD is nog wel van ons, maar het beheer van de computers wordt Amerikaans.
Maar wat nou als je die stap overslaat, en alles door Amerikanen laat doen? Dat is wat de belastingdienst nu van plan is met de BTW.

 > Jason Snell, writing at Six Colors: Perhaps the most surprising announcement on Thursday was that
Apple and Netflix, which have had a rather stand-offish
relationship when it comes to video programming, have struck a
deal to swap some Formula One-related content . Formula One’s
growing popularity in the United States is due, perhaps in large
part, to the high-profile success of the Netflix docuseries “Drive
to Survive.” The latest season of that series, debuting Friday,
will premiere simultaneou

 > The New York Times: Netflix said on Thursday that it had backed away from its deal to
acquire Warner Bros. Discovery, a stunning development that paves
the way for the storied Hollywood media giant to end up under the
control of a rival bidder, the technology heir David Ellison. Netflix said that it would not raise its offer to counter a higher
bid made earlier this week by Mr. Ellison’s company, Paramount
Skydance, adding in a statement that “the deal is no longer
financially attractive.” “This

 > Apple Newsroom: Today, Apple announced iPhone and iPad are the first and only
consumer devices in compliance with the information assurance
requirements of NATO nations. This enables iPhone and iPad to be
used with classified information up to the NATO restricted level
without requiring special software or settings — a level of
government certification no other consumer mobile device has met. That’s nice, but the iPhone is only the second phone to be approved for handling classified information

 > New book, shipping May 19, from author Geoffrey Cain: For twelve years, from 1985 to 1997, Jobs wandered the business
wilderness with his new venture, NeXT. It was a period of
spectacular failures, near-bankruptcy, and brutal humiliation. But
out of this crucible of defeat emerged the visionary leader who
would go on to create the iPod, iPhone, and iPad, transforming
Apple into the most valuable company on earth. Drawing on previously unpublished materials and new interviews
with the key players

 > Bobby Allyn, reporting for NPR: An editor who works for YouTube’s biggest creator, MrBeast, has
been suspended from the prediction market platform Kalshi and
reported to federal regulators for insider trading, Kalshi
officials said on Wednesday. It’s the first time the company has
publicly revealed the results of an investigation into market
manipulation on the popular app. The MrBeast employee, who Kalshi identified as Artem
Kaptur in regulatory filings, traded around $4,000 on
markets related

 > Edison Research: In 2015, AM/FM radio accounted for 75% of the time Americans spent
with spoken-word audio sources. AM/FM radio was not only the most
dominant spoken-word audio listening platform, but it was fully
sixty-five percentage points higher than podcasts, which accounted
for 10% of listening time back then. Quarter by quarter and year
over year, time spent using AM/FM radio to listen to spoken-word
audio has declined significantly and shifted to time spent with
podcasts. As of Q4 2025,

 > Reuters: New York’s attorney general sued Valve, a video game developer
whose franchises include Counter-Strike, Team Fortress and Dota,
accusing it of promoting illegal gambling and threatening to
addict children through its use of “loot boxes.” In a complaint
filed on Wednesday in a state court in Manhattan, Attorney General
Letitia James said Valve’s loot boxes amounted to “quintessential
gambling,” violating the state’s constitution and penal law, with
valuable items often hard to win and ma

All UBI experiments have been small scale, and of course UBI works at a small scale. No shit you can give a few people money and it’s all good and they are happy. Because the people they are buying from aren’t also on UBI. But once you add in the U part…

 > Apparently Apple thinks nobody with a modern Mac uses spinning rust (hard drives with platters) anymore. I plugged in a hard drive from an old iMac into my Mac Studio using my Sabrent USB to SATA Hard Drive enclosure, and opened up Disk Utility, clicked on the top-level disk in the sidebar, and clicked 'Erase'. Lo and behold, there's no 'Security Options' button on there, as there had been since—I believe—the very first version of Disk Utility in Mac OS X!

 > Agentic Engineering Patterns \> Many of my tips for working productively with coding agents are extensions of advice I've found useful in my career without them. Here's a great example of that: hoard things you know how to do . A big part of the skill in building software is understanding what's possible and what isn't, and having at least a rough idea of how those things can be accomplished. These questions can be broad or quite obscure. Can a web page run OCR operations in JavaScript alone? Can

 > It is hard to communicate how much programming has changed due to AI in the last 2 months: not gradually and over time in the "progress as usual" way, but specifically this last December. There are a number of asterisks but imo coding agents basically didn’t work before December and basically work since - the models have significantly higher quality, long-term coherence and tenacity and they can power through large and long tasks, well past enough that it is extremely disruptive to the default p
