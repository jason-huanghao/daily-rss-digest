- [A Cookie for Dario? — Anthropic and selling death](https://anildash.com/2026/02/27/a-cookie-for-dario/)
 > A big tech headline this week is Anthropic (makers of Claude, widely regarded as one of the best LLM platforms) resisting Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth’s calls to modify their platform in order to enable it to support his commission of war crimes . As has become clear this week, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has declined to do so . The administration couches the request as an attempt to use the technology for “lawful purposes”, but given that they’ve also described their recent crimes as legal,

 > Dave Rupert articulated something in “Priority of idle hands” that’s been growing in my subconscious for years: I had a small, intrusive realization the other day that computers and the internet are probably bad for me […] This is hard to accept because a lot of my work, hobbies, education, entertainment, news, communities, and curiosities are all on the internet. I love the internet, it’s a big part of who I am today Hard same. I love computers and the internet. Always have. I feel lucky to hav

 > Mike Masnick, writing for Techdirt: Read that again. If West Virginia wins — if an actual court
orders Apple to start scanning iCloud for CSAM — then every
image flagged by those mandated scans becomes evidence obtained
through a warrantless government search conducted without
probable cause . The Fourth Amendment’s exclusionary rule means
defense attorneys get to walk into court and demand that evidence
be thrown out. And they’ll win that motion. It’s not even a
particularly hard case to make.

 > Rob Griffiths, writing at The Robservatory : So I have macOS Tahoe on my laptop, but I’m keeping my desktop
Mac on macOS Sequoia for now. Which means I have the joy of
seeing things like this wonderful notification on a regular
basis. Or I did, until I found a way to block them, at least in
90 day chunks. [...] The secret? Using device management profiles , which let you
enforce policies on Macs in your organization, even if that
“organization” is one Mac on your desk. One of the available

 > Apple’s solution to this dilemma — to show the “Tap Recents to Call” in Settings if, and only if, Unified is the current view option in the Phone app — is lazy. And as a result, it’s quite confusing.

 > MG Siegler, writing at Spyglass: Of course, Netflix could have absorbed such a cost. It’s a $400B
company (well, before this deal, anyway) — double Disney!
Paramount Skydance? They’re worth $11B. Yes, they’re paying almost
exactly $100B more than they’re worth for WBD. Yes, it’s looney.
But really, it’s leverage. To be clear, Netflix was going to pay for the deal with debt too,
but they have a clear path to repay such debts. They have a great,
growing business. They don’t require the backstop of

 > CNBC: Block said Thursday it’s laying off more than 4,000 employees, or
about half of its head count. The stock skyrocketed as much as 24%
in extended trading. “Today we shared a difficult decision with our team,” Jack
Dorsey, Block’s co-founder and CEO, wrote in a letter to
shareholders . “We’re reducing Block by nearly half, from
over 10,000 people to just under 6,000, which means that over
4,000 people are being asked to leave or entering into
consultation.” [...] Other companies like Pintere

 > How do you manage a company with 50,000 employees? You need processes that give you visibility and control across every function such as technology, logistics, operations, and more. But the moment you try to create a single process to govern everyone, it stops working for anyone. One system can't cater to every team, every workflow, every context. When implemented you start seeing in-fighting, projects missing deadlines, people quitting. Compromises get made, and in my experience, it almost alwa

 > Remember back in the early 2010s when any moderately popular Twitter account could become a book (or even a TV series)?  This is a collection of Tweet-sized "overheard in" stories. All set in book shops.  Isn't it funny that some people don't know how books work! ROFL!  Aren't the general public strange? LOLOL!  That's a bit harsh of me. It only rarely becomes mean-spirited.

 > An AI agent coding skeptic tries AI agent coding, in excessive detail Another in the genre of "OK, coding agents got good in November" posts, this one is by Max Woolf and is very much worth your time. He describes a sequence of coding agent projects, each more ambitious than the last - starting with simple YouTube metadata scrapers and eventually evolving to this: It would be arrogant to port Python's scikit-learn — the gold standard of data science and machine learning libraries — to Rust with

 > Unicode Explorer using binary search over fetch() HTTP range requests Here's a little prototype I built this morning from my phone as an experiment in HTTP range requests, and a general example of using LLMs to satisfy curiosity. I've been collecting HTTP range tricks for a while now, and I decided it would be fun to build something with them myself that used binary search against a large file to do something useful.
