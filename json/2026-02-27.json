    "content": "# Simon Willison’s Weblog\n\nSubscribe\n\n**Sponsored by:** Augment Code — Agent Orchestration. Living Specs. Your favorite agents. Build with Intent.\n\nGuides > Agentic Engineering Patterns\n\n## Hoard things you know how to do\n\nMany of my tips for working productively with coding agents are extensions of advice I've found useful in my career without them. Here's a great example of that: **hoard things you know how to do**.\n\nA big part of the skill in building software is understanding what's possible and what isn't, and having at least a rough idea of how those things can be accomplished.\n\nThese questions can be broad or quite obscure. Can a web page run OCR operations in JavaScript alone? Can an iPhone app pair with a Bluetooth device even when the app isn't running? Can we process a 100GB JSON file in Python without loading the entire thing into memory first?\n\nThe more answers to questions like this you have under your belt, the more likely you'll be able to spot opportunities to deploy technology to solve problems in ways other people may not have thought of yet.\n\nKnowing that something is theoretically possible is not the same as having seen it done for yourself. A key asset to develop as a software professional is a deep collection of answers to questions like this, ideally illustrated by running code.\n\nI hoard solutions like this in a number of different ways. My blog and TIL blog are crammed with notes on things I've figured out how to do. I have over a thousand GitHub repos collecting code I've written for different projects, many of them small proof-of-concepts that demonstrate a key idea.\n\nMore recently I've used LLMs to help expand my collection of code solutions to interesting problems.\n\ntools.simonwillison.net is my largest collection of LLM-assisted tools and prototypes. I use this to collect what I call HTML tools - single HTML pages that embed JavaScript and CSS and solve a specific problem.\n\nMy simonw/research repository has larger, more complex examples where I’ve challenged a coding agent to research a problem and come back with working code and a written report detailing what it found out.\n\n## Recombining things from your hoard\n\nWhy collect all of this stuff? Aside from helping you build and extend your own abilities, the assets you generate along the way become incredibly powerful inputs for your coding agents.\n\nOne of my favorite prompting patterns is to tell an agent to build something new by combining two or more existing working examples.\n\nA project that helped crystallize how effective this can be was the first thing I added to my tools collection - a browser-based OCR tool, described in more detail here.\n\nI wanted an easy, browser-based tool for OCRing pages from PDF files - in particular PDFs that consist entirely of scanned images with no text version provided at all.\n\nI had previously experimented with running the Tesseract.js OCR library in my browser, and found it to be very capable. That library provides a WebAssembly build of the mature Tesseract OCR engine and lets you call it from JavaScript to extract text from an image.\n\nI didn’t want to work with images though, I wanted to work with PDFs. Then I remembered that I had also worked with Mozilla’s PDF.js library, which among other things can turn individual pages of a PDF into rendered images.\n\nI had snippets of JavaScript for both of those libraries in my notes.\n\nHere’s the full prompt I fed into a model (at the time it was Claude 3 Opus), combining my two examples and describing the solution I was looking for:\n\n> This code shows how to open a PDF and turn it into an image per page:\n>\n> ```\n> <!DOCTYPE html>\n> <html>\n> <head>\n>   <title>PDF to Images</title>\n>   <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/pdf.js/2.9.359/pdf.min.js\"></script>\n>   <style>\n>     .image-container img {\n>       margin-bottom: 10px;\n>     }\n>     .image-container p {\n>       margin: 0;\n>       font-size: 14px;\n>       color: #888;\n>     }\n>   </style>\n> </head>\n> <body>\n>   <input type=\"file\" id=\"fileInput\" accept=\".pdf\" />\n>   <div class=\"image-container\"></div>\n>\n>   <script>\n>   const desiredWidth = 800;\n>     const fileInput = document.getElementById('fileInput');\n>     const imageContainer = document.querySelector('.image-container');\n>\n>     fileInput.addEventListener('change', handleFileUpload);\n>\n>     pdfjsLib.GlobalWorkerOptions.workerSrc = 'https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/pdf.js/2.9.359/pdf.worker.min.js';\n>\n>     async function handleFileUpload(event) {\n>       const file = event.target.files[0];\n>       const imageIterator = convertPDFToImages(file);\n>\n>       for await (const { imageURL, size } of imageIterator) {\n>         const imgElement = document.createElement('img');\n>         imgElement.src = imageURL;\n>         imageContainer.appendChild(imgElement);\n>\n>         const sizeElement = document.createElement('p');\n>         sizeElement.textContent = `Size: ${formatSize(size)}`;\n>         imageContainer.appendChild(sizeElement);\n>       }\n>     }\n>\n>     async function* convertPDFToImages(file) {\n>       try {\n>         const pdf = await pdfjsLib.getDocument(URL.createObjectURL(file)).promise;\n>         const numPages = pdf.numPages;\n>\n>         for (let i = 1;

// Set the OCR result to the alt textarea\n>           progressBar.value += 1;\n>         }\n>       }\n>\n>       await worker.terminate();\n>       ocrButton.innerText = \"OCR complete\";\n>     };\n>   }\n> ```\n>\n> Use these examples to put together a single HTML page with embedded HTML and CSS and JavaScript that provides a big square which users can drag and drop a PDF file onto and when they do that the PDF has every page converted to a JPEG and shown below on the page, then OCR is run with tesseract and the results are shown in textarea blocks below each image.\n\nThis worked flawlessly! The model kicked out a proof-of-concept page that did exactly what I needed.\n\nI ended up iterating with it a few times to get to my final result, but it took just a few minutes to build a genuinely useful tool that I’ve benefited from ever since.\n\n## Coding agents make this even more powerful\n\nI built that OCR example back in March 2024, nearly a year before the first release of Claude Code. Coding agents have made hoarding working examples even more valuable.\n\nIf your coding agent has internet access you can tell it to do things like:\n\n> Use curl to fetch the source of `https://tools.simonwillison.net/ocr` and `https://tools.simonwillison.net/gemini-bbox` and build a new tool that lets you select a page from a PDF and pass it to Gemini to return bounding boxes for illustrations on that page.\n\n(I specified `curl` there because Claude Code defaults to using a WebFetch tool which summarizes the page content rather than returning the raw HTML.)\n\nCoding agents are excellent at search, which means you can run them on your own machine and tell them where to find the examples of things you want them to do:\n\n> Add mocked HTTP tests to the `~/dev/ecosystem/datasette-oauth` project inspired by how `~/dev/ecosystem/llm-mistral` is doing it.\n\nOften that's enough - the agent will fire up a search sub-agent to investigate and pull back just the details it needs to achieve the task.\n\nSince so much of my research code is public I'll often tell coding agents to clone my repositories to `/tmp` and use them as input:\n\n> Clone `simonw/research` from GitHub to `/tmp` and find examples of compiling Rust to WebAssembly, then use that to build a demo HTML page for this project.\n\nThe key idea here is that coding agents mean we only ever need to figure out a useful trick *once*. If that trick is then documented somewhere with a working code example our agents can consult that example and use it to solve any similar shaped project in the future.\n\n← Writing code is cheap now\n\nRed/green TDD →\n\nThis is a chapter from the guide **Agentic Engineering Patterns**.\n\n**Chapters in this guide**\n\n1. **Principles**\n   1.

    "content": "# How to Securely Erase an old Hard Drive on macOS Tahoe\n\nFeb 26, 2026\n\nApparently Apple thinks nobody with a modern Mac uses spinning rust (hard drives with platters) anymore.\n\nI plugged in a hard drive from an old iMac into my Mac Studio using my Sabrent USB to SATA Hard Drive enclosure, and opened up Disk Utility, clicked on the top-level disk in the sidebar, and clicked 'Erase'.\n\n![Secure Erase option missing in macOS Tahoe Disk Utility](/blog/2026/securely-erase-hard-drive-macos-tahoe/no-secure-erase-sabrent-media-macos-tahoe-disk-utility.png)\n\nLo and behold, there's no 'Security Options' button on there, as there had been since—I believe—the very first version of Disk Utility in Mac OS X!\n\nIt seems like this option may have been dropped in macOS 15 Sequoia, but regardless, if you want to write 1s, 0s, or do a DOE-compliant 3-pass erase, you have to hop over to Terminal now.\n\nApple apparently hasn't gotten the memo, as their macOS 26 Tahoe Disk Utility User Guide currently states1:\n\n> (Optional) If available, click Security Options, use the slider to choose how many times to write over the erased data, then click OK.\n>\n> Secure erase options are available only for some types of storage devices. If the Security Options button is not available, Disk Utility cannot perform a secure erase on the storage device.\n\n## Secure Erase with `diskutil` in Terminal\n\nFirst, find your disk using `diskutil list`:\n\n```\n$ diskutil list\n/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk0\n   1:             Apple_APFS_ISC Container disk1         524.3 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                 Apple_APFS Container disk3         994.7 GB   disk0s2\n   3:        Apple_APFS_Recovery Container disk2         5.4 GB     disk0s3\n...\n/dev/disk9 (external, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk9\n   1:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            1.0 TB     disk9s1\n```\n\nMine is `/dev/disk9`. Run the command `diskutil secureErase` on that disk, providing an integer for the secure option:\n\n```\n0 - Single-pass erase resulting in a zero fill.\n1 - Single-pass erase resulting in a random-number fill.\n2 - Seven-pass \"secure\" erase.\n3 - Gutmann algorithm 35-pass \"secure\" erase.\n4 - Three-pass \"secure\" erase.\n```\n\nFor example:\n\n```\n$ diskutil secureErase 1 /dev/disk9\nStarted erase on disk9\n[ / 0%..10%.............................................. ] 10.5%\n```\n\n`diskutil`'s docs warn `Level 2, 3, or 4 secure erases can take an extremely long time`, but even a single pass takes a while on older drives, or some of the largest modern drives with 16+ TB. SATA performance has sadly not kept up with the times.\n\n---\n\n1.

    "content": "Last time, we saw that one way to intercept the `ESC` in the standard dialog message loop is  to use your own dialog message loop. However, you might not be able to do this, say, because the dialog procedure uses `End­Dialog()`, and the dialog exit code is not retrievable from a custom message loop.\n\nThe `Is­Dialog­Message` includes an extensibility point that lets you hook into the message processing. You can register a message filter hook and listen for `MSGF_DIALOG­BOX`.\n\nBefore processing a message, the `Is­Dialog­Message` function does a `Call­Msg­Filter` with the message that it is about to process and the filter code `MSGF_DIALOG­BOX`. If the filter result is nonzero (indicating that one of the hooks wanted to block default processing), then the `Is­Dialog­Message` returns without doing anything. This lets us grab the `ESC` from `Is­Dialog­Message` before it turns into an `IDCANCEL`.\n\nHere’s our first attempt. (There will be more than one.)\n\n```\nHWND hdlgHook;\r\n#define DM_ESCPRESSED (WM_USER + 100)\r\n\r\nLRESULT CALLBACK DialogEscHookProc(int nCode, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam)\r\n{\r\n    if (code == MSGF_DIALOGBOX) {\r\n        auto msg = (MSG*)lParam;\r\n        if (IsDialogESC(hdlgHook, msg)) {\r\n            return SendMessage(hdlg, DM_ESCPRESSED, 0, lParam);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    return CallNextHookEx(nullptr, nCode, wParam, lParam);\r\n}\r\n```\n\nOur hook procedure first checks that it’s being called by `Is­Dialog­Message`. if so, and the message is a press of the `ESC` key destined for our dialog box (or a control on that dialog box), then send the dialog box a `DM_ESC­PRESSED` message to ask it what it thinks. The dialog procedure can return `TRUE` to block default processing or `FALSE` to allow default processing to continue.\n\nHere is the handler in the dialog procedure itself:\n\n```\nINT_PTR CALLBACK DialogProc(HWND hdlg, UINT message, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam)\r\n{\r\n    switch (message) {\r\n    case WM_INITDIALOG:\r\n        hdlgHook = hdlg;\r\n        ⟦ other dialog initialization as before ⟧\r\n        ⟦ ending with \"return (whatever)\" ⟧\r\n\r\n    case DM_ESCPRESSED:\r\n        if (⟦ we want to process the ESC key ourselves ⟧) {\r\n            ⟦ do custom ESC key processing ⟧\r\n            SetWindowLongPtr(hdlg, DWLP_MSGRESULT, TRUE);\r\n            return TRUE;\r\n        }\r\n        break;\r\n    ⟦ handle other messages ⟧\r\n    }\r\n    return FALSE;\r\n}\r\n```\n\nWhen the dialog initializes, remember its handle as the dialog for which the `Dialog­Esc­Hook­Proc` is operating.\n\nWhen the dialog is informed that the `ESC` key was pressed, we decide whether we want to process the `ESC` key ourselves. If so, then we do that custom processing and set up to return `TRUE` from the window procedure. For dialog procedures, this is done by setting the message result to the desired window procedure result and then returning `TRUE` to block default dialog box message processing and instead return the value we set (which is `TRUE`) from the window procedure.\n\nFinally, we install the message hook before we create the dialog box and remove it when the dialog box dismisses.\n\n```\nauto hook = SetWindowsHookEx(WM_MSGFILTER, DialogEscHookProc,\r\n                             nullptr, GetCurrentThreadId());\r\nauto result = DialogBox(hinst, MAKEINTRESOURCE(IDD_WHATEVER),\r\n                        hwndOwner, DialogProc);\r\nUnhookWindowsHookEx(hook);\r\n```\n\nThis is the basic idea, but we see that there are a few problems.\n\nOne is that we are communicating the dialog box handle through a global variable. This means that we can’t have multiple threads using this hook at the same time. Fortunately, that can be fixed by changing the variable to be `thread_local`, although this does drag in the cost of thread-local variables.\n\nBut even if we do that, we have a problem if two copies of this dialog box are shown *by the same thread*. For example, one of the controls in the dialog might launch another copy of this dialog, but with different parameters. For example, a “View certificate” dialog might have a button called “View parent certificate”.\n\nWe’ll take up these issues (and others) next time.",

If Pete Hegseth forces Dario Amodei to fold, not one but two monstrous precedents will be set.\n\nThe first is obvious, and terrible in itself. The second is subtle but no less important.\n\nThe first is that what Secretary Hegseth is demanding, backed by heavy threats, is that the US military have full, unrestricted access to Anthropic’s AI software, for applications such as military surveillance and autonomous weapons without humans in the loop. This could well extend to nuclear weapons.1\n\nNothing that I have read convinces me that Secretary Hegseth has a nuanced understanding of the strengths and limits of current AI, or that he will show restraint in how he applies it. Rather he is trying to define his career in part around deploying AI as broadly and as quickly as possible.\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!IeRm!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffbe4d758-a714-4f08-9e94-4e2733bc645a_910x568.png)\n\nThe second is that Hegseth’s maneuver is an audacious power grabs that aims to circumvent Congress. By setting a deadline of 5:01 PM eastern tomorrow, Hegseth aims to cut everybody else – even Congress — out of the loop.\n\nA reader of this newsletter, a tech writer who describes himself as a political independent just wrote to me, rightfully panicked:\n\n*Today the Pentagon will force Anthropic to change their corporate goal of responsible AI. This is not something to be decided in the marketplace by a bully with deep pockets; it must be decided in Congress. Senators and Congressmen must take a position and deliberate in public about whether it is OK to use AI for surveillance of Americans and to launch lethal strikes controlled by AI with no “human in the loop”. Please say something today, before Amodei has to surrender.*\n\nHe is right.\n\nPlease call or write your Senators and Representatives  ***right*** ***now***.\n\n§\n\nAI policy, especially of this magnitude, is something that American people should have a say in. Congress should deliberate. Mass surveillance and AI-fueled weapons, possibly nuclear, without humans in the loop are categorically not things that one individual, even one in the Cabinet, should be allowed to decide at a gunpoint.\n\nBut that is *exactly* where we are headed.\n\n1\n\nHegsseth’s demand would in principle extend to apply Anthropic’s software to nuclear weapons without humans in the loop. In that connection, people should probably be aware of the fact that S. 1394 - Block Nuclear Launch by Autonomous Artificial Intelligence Act of 2023 failed to pass. Which means we might not have a Stanislav Petrov next time around.\n\n288\n\n79\n\n71\n\nShare",

Reload enough times and you might run into some unusual tower shapes, and the Konami code does what you’d hope.\n\nThe info button shows the tower’s seed, which you can share as a `?seed=` URL parameter, basically a way to say “look at this disaster” and have someone else see the exact same precarious arrangement.\n\nSome ways this could go further:\n\n* Upload an SBOM and build the tower from your actual dependency tree, with block sizes based on how many other packages depend on each one\n* Pull real dependency data from ecosyste.ms so you can see what your project’s tower looks like before you start pulling blocks out\n* Use the phone’s accelerometer to let you tilt and topple the tower\n\nSource on GitHub.",

Because the people they are buying from aren’t also on UBI. But once you add in the U part…\n\nWhat do you plan to buy with your free government dollars? Want to buy eggs? Sorry, the egg people stopped making eggs, they are living free on UBI. Want to buy a house? Who built it? Nobody, because they all were getting UBI and didn’t want to build houses anymore. They write poems now. There’s still old houses available, but the price for them has 20xed, well outside of what you can afford.\n\nBelief in UBI comes from a fallacy that the economy is some natural thing. I see supermarket. Supermarket has eggs for $5. I get $10,000 UBI. I can buy 2,000 eggs. Of course this isn’t what happens. Like most things politicians invent, nobody considered the second order effects, and you will not be getting 2,000 eggs with your UBI. Cause everyone got the UBI and bought the eggs. Either no more eggs or price of eggs goes up. And even worse, many people quit work once they got the UBI. So now less eggs are made. And your whole UBI check gets you 6 or 7 eggs instead of 2,000, if that.\n\n---\n\nThe root of this stupidity is that *people see themselves apart from society*. They don’t know where stuff comes from, it might as well be the stuff fairy that puts it on the supermarket shelves and sets prices. If the stuff fairy was real, UBI might make sense. But we live in a society. We work for each other. At least the adults do. There already is UBI in the world for some people, it’s called allowance. It’s for children and high-end prostitutes.\n\nIt reminds me of the episode of Malcolm in the Middle where Malcolm dates this dumb hot girl, and she suggests solving poverty by making every 1 dollar bill into a million dollar bill. Have the UBI people considered that idea?\n\nWhat comes first, actually trying UBI or the end of democracy?\n\n---\n\n(what you actually want is for everything to be cheap to produce. but sorry, 6 citizens “have concerns” and now we have six more weeks of expensive memory.

    "content": "> **Editor's note: a previous version of this newsletter went out with Matt Hughes' name on it, that's my editor who went over it for spelling errors and loaded it into the CMS. Sorry!**\n\nHey all! I’m going to start hammering out free pieces again after a brief hiatus, mostly because I found myself trying to boil the ocean with each one, fearing that if I regularly emailed you you’d unsubscribe. I eventually realized how silly that was, so I’m back, and will be back more regularly. I’ll treat it like a column, which will be both easier to write and a lot more fun.\n\nAs ever, if you like this piece and want to support my work, please subscribe to my premium newsletter. It’s $70 a year, or $7 a month, and in return you get a weekly newsletter that’s usually anywhere from 5000 to 18,000 words, including vast, extremely detailed analyses of NVIDIA, Anthropic and OpenAI’s finances, and the AI bubble writ large. I am regularly several steps ahead in my coverage, and you get an absolute ton of value. In the bottom right hand corner of your screen you’ll see a red circle — click that and select either monthly or annual.  Next year I expect to expand to other areas too. It’ll be great. You’re gonna love it.\n\n---\n\nBefore we go any further, I want to remind everybody I’m not a stock analyst nor do I give investment advice.\n\nI do, however, want to say a few things about NVIDIA and its annual earnings report, which it published on Wednesday, February 25:\n\n1. NVIDIA beat estimates and raised expectations, as it has quarter after quarter. People were initially excited, then started reading the 10-K and seeing weird little things that stood out.\n2. $68.1 billion in revenue is a lot of money! That’s what you should expect from a company that is the single vendor in the only thing anybody talks about.\n3. Hyperscaler revenue accounted for slightly more than 50% of NVIDIA’s data center revenue. As I wrote about last year, NVIDIA’s diversified revenue — that’s the revenue that comes from companies that *aren’t* in the magnificent 7 — continues to collapse. While data center revenue was $62.3 billion, 50% ($31.15 billion) was taken up by hyperscalers…and because we don’t get a 10-Q for the fourth quarter, we don’t get a breakdown of how many individual customers made up that quarter’s revenue. Boo!\n4. It is both peculiar and worrying that 36% (around $77.7 billion) of its $215.938 billion in FY2026 revenue came from *two customers.* If I had to guess, they’re likely Foxconn or Quanta computing, two large Taiwanese ODMs (Original Design Manufacturers) that build the servers for most hyperscalers.\n   1. If you want to know more, I wrote a long premium piece that goes into it (among the ways in which AI is worse than the dot com bubble). In simple terms, when a hyperscaler buys GPUs, they go straight to one of these ODMs to put them into servers. This isn’t out of the ordinary, but I keep an eye on the ODM revenues (which publish every month) to see if anything shifts, as I think it’ll be one of the first signs that things are collapsing.\n5. NVIDIA’s inventories continue to grow, sitting at over $21 billion (up from around $19 billion last quarter). Could be normal! Could mean stuff isn’t shipping.\n6. NVIDIA has now agreed to $27 billion in multi-year-long cloud service agreements — literally renting its GPUs back from the people it sells them to — with ***$7 billion*** of that expected in its FY2027 (Q1 FY2027 will report in May 2026).\n   1. For some context, CoreWeave (which reports FY2025 earnings today, February 26) gave guidance last November that it expected its entire annual revenue to be between $5 billion and $5.15 billion. CoreWeave is arguably the largest AI compute vendor outside of the hyperscalers. If there was significant demand, none of this would be necessary.\n7. NVIDIA “invested” $17.5bn in AI model makers and other early-stage AI startups, and made a further $3.5bn in land, power, and shell guarantees to “support the build-out of complex datacenter infrastructures.” In total, it spent $21bn propping up the ecosystem that, in turn, feeds billions of dollars into its coffers.\n8. NVIDIA’s long-term supply and capacity obligations soared from $30.8bn to $95.2bn, largely because NVIDIA’s latest chips are extremely complex and require TSMC to make significant investments in hardware and facilities, and it’s unwilling to do that without receiving guarantees that it’ll make its money back.\n   1. NVIDIA expects these obligations to *grow*.\n9. NVIDIA’s accounts receivable (as in goods that have been shipped but are yet to be paid for) now sits at $38.4 billion, of which 56% ($21.5 billion) is from three customers.\n\nNVIDIA’s entire future is built on the idea that hyperscalers will buy GPUs at increasingly-higher prices and at increasingly-higher rates every single year. It is completely reliant on maybe four or five companies being willing to shove tens of billions of dollars a quarter directly into Jensen Huang’s wallet. If anything changes here — such as difficulty acquiring debt or investor pressure cutting capex — NVIDIA is in real trouble, as it’s made over $95 billion in commitments to build out for the AI bubble.\n\nYet the real gem was this part:\n\n> We are finalizing an investment and partnership agreement with OpenAI. There is no assurance that we will enter into an investment and partnership agreement with OpenAI or that a transaction will be completed.\n\nHell yeah dude! After misleading everybody that it intended to invest $100 billion in OpenAI last year (as I warned everybody about months ago, the deal never existed and is now effectively dead), NVIDIA was allegedly “close” to investing $30 billion. One would think that NVIDIA would, after Huang awkwardly tried to claim that the $100 billion was “never a commitment,” say with its full chest how badly it wanted to support OpenAI and how *intentionally it would do so.*\n\nEspecially when you have this note in your 10-K:\n\n> We estimate that one AI research and deployment company contributed to a meaningful amount of our revenue purchasing cloud services from our customers in fiscal year 2026\n\nWhat a peculiar world we live in. Apparently NVIDIA is “so close” to a “partnership agreement” too, though it’s important to remember that Altman, Brockman, and Huang went on CNBC to talk about the last deal and that never came together.\n\nAll of this adds a little more anxiety to OpenAI's alleged $100 billion funding round which, as The Information reports, Amazon's alleged $50 billion investment will actually be $15 billion, with the next $35 billion contingent on AGI or an IPO:\n\n> Under the terms of the investment, which are still being negotiated, Amazon would initially invest $15 billion into OpenAI, these people said. The other $35 billion could hinge on OpenAI reaching AGI or going public, the people said. The proposed Amazon investment is part of OpenAI’s current funding round, which could top $100 billion at a valuation of $730 billion before the financing.\n\nAnd that $30 billion from NVIDIA is shaping up to be a Klarna-esque three-installment payment plan:\n\n> In addition, SoftBank and Nvidia each plan to invest $30 billion in three installments through the year as part of the round, said the people. Microsoft had been expected to invest low billions of dollars, The Information previously reported, but it could invest a smaller amount or none at all, according to two of the people.\n\nA few thoughts:\n\n* This is turning into a very involved and convoluted process! It turns out that it's pretty difficult to actually raise $100 billion.\n* This is a big problem, because OpenAI needs $655 billion in the next five years to pay all its bills, and loses billions of dollars a year.\n* If OpenAI is struggling to raise $100 billion today, I don't see how it's possible it survives. If you're to believe reports, OpenAI made $13.1 billion in revenue in 2025 on $8 billion of losses, but remember, my own reporting from last year said that OpenAI only made around $4.329 billion through September 2025 with $8.67 billion of inference costs alone.\n  + It is kind of weird that nobody seems to acknowledge my reporting on this subject.\n* I do not see how OpenAI survives.\n\nAnyway, on to the main event.\n\n---\n\nNew term: analyslop, when somebody writes a long, specious piece of writing with few facts or actual statements with the intention of it being read as thorough analysis.\n\nThis week, alleged financial analyst Citrini Research (not to be confused with Andrew Left’s Citron Research)  put out a truly awful piece called the “2028 Global Intelligence Crisis,” slop-filled scare-fiction written and framed with the authority of deeply-founded analysis, so much so that it caused a global selloff in stocks.\n\nThis piece — if you haven’t read it, please do so using my annotated version — spends 7000 or more words telling the dire tale of what would happen if AI made an indeterminately-large amount of white collar workers redundant.\n\nIt isn’t clear *what* exactly AI does, who makes the AI, or how the AI works, just that it replaces people, and then bad stuff happens. Citrini insists that this “isn’t bear porn or AI-doomer fan-fiction,” but that’s exactly what it is — mediocre analyslop framed in the trappings of analysis, sold on a Substack with “research” in the title, specifically written to spook *and* ingratiate anyone involved in the financial markets.\n\nIts goal is to convince you that AI (non-specifically) is scary, that your current stocks are bad, and that AI stocks (unclear which ones those are, by the way) are the future. Also, find out more for $999 a year.\n\nLet me give you an example:\n\n> It should have been clear all along that a single GPU cluster in North Dakota generating the output previously attributed to 10,000 white collar workers in midtown Manhattan is more economic pandemic than economic panacea.\n\nThe goal of a paragraph like this is for you to say “wow, that’s what GPUs are doing now!” It isn’t, of course. The majority of CEOs report little or no return on investment from AI, with a study of 6000 CEOs across the US, UK, Germany and Australia finding that “more than 80% \n\n[detected] no discernable impact from AI on either employment or productivity.” Nevertheless, you read “GPU” and “North Dakota” and you think “wow! That’s a place I know, and I know that GPUs power AI!”\n\nI know a GPU cluster in North Dakota — CoreWeave’s one with Applied Digital that has debt so severe that it loses both companies money even if they have the capacity rented out 24/7. But let’s not let facts get in the way of a poorly-written story.\n\nI don’t need to go line-by-line — mostly because I’ll end up writing a legally-actionable threat — but I need you to know that most of this piece’s arguments come down to magical thinking and the utterly empty prose.\n\nFor example, how does AI take over the entire economy?\n\n> AI capabilities improved, companies needed fewer workers, white collar layoffs increased, displaced workers spent less, margin pressure pushed firms to invest more in AI, AI capabilities improved…\n\nThat’s right, they just get better. No need to discuss anything happening today. Even AI 2027 had the balls to start making stuff about “OpenBrain” or whatever.\n\nThis piece literally just says stuff, including one particularly-egregious lie:\n\n> In late 2025, agentic coding tools took a step function jump in capability.  \n>   \n> A competent developer working with Claude Code or Codex could now replicate the core functionality of a mid-market SaaS product in weeks. Not perfectly or with every edge case handled, but well enough that the CIO reviewing a $500k annual renewal started asking the question “what if we just built this ourselves?”\n\nThis is a complete and utter lie. A bald-faced lie. This is not something that Claude Code can do. The fact that we have major media outlets quoting this piece suggests that those responsible for explaining how things work don’t actually bother to do any of the work to find out, and it’s both a disgrace and embarrassment for the tech and business media that these lies continue to be peddled.\n\nI’m now going to quote part of my upcoming premium (the Hater’s Guide To Private Equity, out Friday), because I think it’s time we talked about what Claude Code actually does.\n\n> It is not just a matter of “enough prompts until it does this.”  Good (or even functional!) software engineering is technical, infrastructural and philosophical, and the thing you are “automating” is not just the code that makes a thing run.   \n>   \n> Let's start with the simplest, and least-technical way of putting it: even in the best-case scenario, you do not just type \"Build Be A Salesforce Competitor\" and it erupts, fully-formed, from your Terminal window. It is not capable of building it, but even if it were, it would need to actually be on a cloud hosting platform, and have all manner of actual customer data entered into it.   \n>   \n> Building software is not writing code and then hitting enter and a website appears, requiring all manner of infrastructural things (such as \"how does a customer access it in a consistent and reliable way,\" \"how do I make sure that this can handle a lot of people at once,\" and \"is it quick to access,\" with the more-complex database systems requiring entirely separate subscriptions just to keep them connecting).   \n>   \n> Software is a tremendous pain in the ass. You write code, then you have to make sure the code actually runs, and that code needs to run in some cases on specific hardware, and that hardware needs to be set up right, and some things are written in different languages, and those languages sometimes use more memory or less memory and if you give them the wrong amounts or forget to close the door in your code on something everything breaks, sometimes costing you money or introducing security vulnerabilities.   \n>   \n> In any case, even for experienced, well-versed software engineers, maintaining software that involves any kind of customer data requires significant investments in compliance, including things like SOC-2 audits if the customer itself ever has to interact with the system, as well as security.   \n>   \n> And yet, the myth that LLMs are an existential threat to existing software companies has taken root in the market, sending the share prices of the legacy incumbents tumbling. A great example would be SAP, down 10% in the last month.   \n>   \n> SAP makes ERP software (Enterprise Resource Planning, which I wrote about in the Hater's Guide To Oracle), and has been affected by the sell-off. SAP is also a massive, complex, resource-intensive database-driven system that involves things like accounting, provisioning, and HR, and is so heinously complex that you often have to pay SAP just to make it function (if you're lucky it might even do so). If you were to build this kind of system yourself, even with \"the magic of Claude Code\" (which I will get to shortly), it ...",

The suit features brands like 'Android,' 'DP World,' and 'Cisco.' He has a focused expression, and the background shows a clear sky and a building.](https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/netflix-f1-6c.jpg?ssl=1)  \n\nIt’s almost time for the green flag.\n\nAfter lengthy rumors, last October Apple announced it had bought the U.S. rights to the Formula One racing circuit. Next week, the races begin, and Apple has now detailed the viewing experience for the season.\n\nFirst, the basics: Every Apple TV subscriber has access to all the video feeds from live races, practices, and qualifying. There’s no separate package to buy, and all the video will be available within the TV app on all of Apple’s platforms as well as many other smart TVs and connected devices.\n\nAccording to Apple SVP of Services Eddy Cue, race video will be in 4K HDR with 5.1 audio. Cue said that like Apple’s other sports broadcasts, the video will be less compressed than content from other services, one reason Apple’s stuff tends to look better than the competition.\n\nThe TV app supports Multiview, which allows for the display of up to four video feeds at one time. To make it easier on users who might be uncomfortable building a custom Multiview layout, the app will be able to build different combinations of multiview with just one click—for example, if you click the Red Bull multiview option, you’ll get a large view of the race feed with smaller onboard views from the two Red Bull cars. (You can also set up custom Multiviews and even edit the ones created by the presets.)\n\nEvery session will be presented in both English and Spanish audio, and Apple is using the F1 TV feed as its primary feed—but also offering the very popular Sky Sports video feed as an option, and either feed can be used with Multiview. There are 30 extra feeds, including a race tracker; driver data; “podium channels” that show the video of whichever cars are in first, second, and third place; and all 22 driver cameras.\n\nUsers of Apple’s Vision Pro won’t get a 3D race map (yet—though that would be amazing, wouldn’t it?), but they can add a fifth camera view to the multiview for an even more immersive experience.\n\nAccording to Cue, Apple was inspired to become a Formula One broadcaster after working with the circuit on “F1: The Movie.” “What it really did is it let our teams work together for years, and what I discovered is we shared the same vision, in the sense of being innovative and focused on providing the best fan experience,” he said.\n\nPerhaps the most surprising announcement on Thursday was that Apple and Netflix, which have had a rather stand-offish relationship when it comes to video programming, have struck a deal to swap some Formula One-related content. Formula One’s growing popularity in the United States is due, perhaps in large part, to the high-profile success of the Netflix docuseries “Drive to Survive.” The latest season of that series, debuting Friday, will premiere simultaneously on both Netflix and Apple TV. Presumably, in exchange for that non-exclusive, Apple will also non-exclusively allow Netflix to broadcast the Canadian Grand Prix in May. (Insert obligatory wish that Apple and Netflix would bury the hatchet and enable Watch Now support in the TV app for Netflix content.)\n\nNetflix isn’t Apple’s only F1 content partner. The company said it would be providing free streamer Tubi with “exclusive alt-casts for multiple races.” An alt-cast is an alternative version of the main broadcast, like the Manning Brothers doing a sort of live podcast during a Monday Night Football game or Nickelodeon’s animated take on live NFL broadcasts. It’s unclear what the Tubi alt-cast will actually be, but I love the idea of Apple embracing the alt-cast concept—and using it to find a different audience with a partner.\n\nSince Apple’s rights are limited to the U.S., I assume most of these partnerships will involve races that take place during waking hours, since many races do tend to start in the middle of the night over here. On that note, Apple did emphasize that it’s working hard not to spoil the results of races in the TV app, since many American fans will watch on a time-delayed basis.\n\nOther partners Apple announced Thursday were IMAX (select World Championship races will be shown on IMAX screens in the U.S., again presumably ones taking place during waking hours), Comcast, Everpass, Prime Video, and DirecTV. Some of those may just offer resold versions of Apple TV, and others (like Everpass and DirecTV) will make races available to commercial establishments like bars and restaurants.\n\nOn Thursday, both parties pitched their relationship as not being between Apple TV and Formula One, but between *Apple* and Formula One. Following last year’s Monaco maps tied to the Grand Prix, Apple added fancy Melbourne maps in advance of next week’s race, and I’d expect more fancy racing-focused maps in the future. Apple Music, Fitness, Podcasts, Sports, and even its retail stores will be part of a larger Formula One push. It’s clear that the playbook Apple used to push “F1: The Movie” will continue with this wider relationship, at least in the U.S.\n\nLast November, I got to experience watching a Formula One race with my pal Myke Hurley, who is an avid F1 fan. It was a pretty good time, and I’m looking forward to seeing how Apple’s implementation of all these features works out during next week’s race. It won’t be so fun to watch without Myke, though. Maybe I’ll FaceTime him during the race.\n\n* Report a typo\n* Discuss in members Discord (app)\n\n**If you appreciate articles like this one, support us by becoming a Six Colors subscriber.

What happened next would transform not only his life and career, but the future of technology itself.\n\nPreorder Now\n\n![](https://geoffreycain.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/steve-jobs-in-exile-geoffrey-cain-book-2026-706x1024.webp)\n\n![Steve Jobs in Exile by Geoffrey Cain book](https://geoffreycain.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/steve-jobs-in-exile-geoffrey-cain-book-939x1024.webp)\n\n![Amazon Books logo](https://geoffreycain.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/logo_amazon.webp)\n\n![](https://geoffreycain.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/logo_brnesNoble.webp)\n\n![](https://geoffreycain.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/logo_audible.webp)\n\n![Bookshop org logo](https://geoffreycain.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/bookshop-org-logo-book.webp)\n\n![apple books logo](https://geoffreycain.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/logo_appleBooks.webp)\n\n![](https://geoffreycain.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/booksamillion.webp)\n\nFor twelve years, from 1985 to 1997, Jobs wandered the business wilderness with his new venture, NeXT. It was a period of spectacular failures, near-bankruptcy, and brutal humiliation. But out of this crucible of defeat emerged the visionary leader who would go on to create the iPod, iPhone, and iPad, transforming Apple into the most valuable company on earth.\n\nDrawing on previously unpublished materials and new interviews with the key players, Geoffrey Cain reveals the untold story of Steve Jobs’s “lost decade”—the formative years that shaped the icon we thought we knew.\n\nWith unprecedented access to unbroadcast footage of Jobs in NeXT meetings, private company documents, and interviews with his closest colleagues, Cain offers the definitive account of how failure transformed a brash wunderkind into a true business genius.\n\nThis is the story of how Steve Jobs learned to lead, how he discovered the power of discipline, and how a spectacular failure became the foundation for one of the greatest comebacks in business history.\nIt is nothing less than the missing piece in the legend of Steve Jobs.\n\n## Coming May 19, 2026\n\n## Praise for\n\n## Steve Jobs in Exile\n\n“Finally!

    "content": "# Notepad and Paint updates begin rolling out to Windows Insiders\n\nWritten By\n\n* Dave Grochocki\n\npublished\n\nJanuary 21, 2026\n\nHello Windows Insiders, today we are beginning to roll out updates for Notepad and Paint apps to Windows Insiders in the Canary and Dev Channels on Windows 11.\n\n## **Notepad (version 11.2512.10.0)**\n\nIn this update, we’re introducing multiple improvements to Notepad.\n\nFirst, we are expanding support of lightweight formatting to include additional Markdown syntax features. This includes strikethrough formatting and nested lists. To get started, explore these new options in the formatting toolbar, keyboard shortcuts, or by editing the Markdown syntax directly.\n\n![Notepad app screenshot of a nested list and strikethrough formatted created using the Increase indent command.](https://winblogs.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/44/2026/01/1-Notepad-Strikethrough_Nested-list.png)\n\nNotepad app screenshot of a nested list and strikethrough formatted created using the Increase indent command.\n\nWe are also introducing a new welcome experience in Notepad designed to help users discover and learn about the app’s latest and most useful features. This dialog provides a quick overview of what’s possible in Notepad and serves as a helpful starting point for both new and returning users. You can close it anytime and revisit it later by clicking the megaphone icon in the top-right corner of the toolbar.\n\n![Notepad app screenshot of the updated “What’s New” first run experience.](https://winblogs.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/44/2026/01/2-Notepad-Whats-New-1024x897.png)\n\nNotepad app screenshot of the updated “What’s New” first run experience.\n\nFinally, we are expanding support for streaming results for AI text features. Whether generated locally or in the cloud, results for Write, Rewrite, and Summarize will start to appear quicker without the need to wait for the full response, providing a preview sooner that you can interact with. To use Write, Rewrite, and Summarize in Notepad, you will need to sign in with your Microsoft account.\n\n**FEEDBACK: Please file feedback in Feedback Hub (WIN + F)****under Apps > Notepad****.**\n\n## **Paint (version 11.2512.191.0)**\n\nIn this update, we’re introducing two new features to Paint, Coloring book and fill tolerance slider.\n\n**Coloring book**, an AI-powered feature that lets you create unique coloring book pages from a text prompt. To get started, open Paint and select the **Coloring book** option from the Copilot menu. Once the side panel is open, type in a description of the coloring book you want to create, like “a cute fluffy cat on a donut” or “a house with a garden and fence” and hit the **Generate** button. Paint will then generate a set of unique coloring book pages based on your prompt. Once the coloring book pages are generated, you can click on any one of them to Add to canvas, copy, or save it for later use.\n\n![Paint app showing a cat on a donut coloring book page.](https://winblogs.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/44/2026/01/3-Paint_Coloring_book-1-1024x676.png)\n\nPaint app showing a cat on a donut coloring book page.\n\n*Coloring book will be available only on Copilot+ PCs. To use Coloring book, you will need to sign in with your Microsoft account.*\n\nWe’re also adding a fill tolerance slider, giving you control over how precisely the Fill tool applies color. To get started, select the **Fill** tool and use the slider on the left side of the canvas to adjust the tolerance to your desired level. Experiment with different tolerance settings to achieve clean fills or creative effects.\n\n![Paint app showing Fill tool with tolerance set to 8% versus 18%. ](https://winblogs.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/44/2026/01/Fill_Tolerance-1.gif)\n\nPaint app showing Fill tool with tolerance set to 8% versus 18%.\n\n**FEEDBACK: Please file feedback in Feedback Hub (WIN + F)****under Apps > Paint****.**\n\nAs always, we love getting feedback from the community and we will be looking out for your thoughts and suggestions on these updates!\n\nThanks,  \nDave Grochocki, Principal Group Product Manager – Windows Inbox Apps\n\nTags:\n\nWindows Insider Program",

It's the first time the company has publicly revealed the results of an investigation into market manipulation on the popular app.\n\n![Standing in front of an electronic keyboard set up on a football field, singer Charlie Puth performs the national anthem ahead of this year's Super Bowl on February 8.](https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3776x3776+2020+0/resize/100/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F2b%2F4d%2F4f71190c4eb0bad752b0e1b2bbd3%2Fgettyimages-2260097704.jpg)\n\n### Technology\n\n### TV antennas and Super Bowl rehearsals: How prediction market traders seek an edge\n\nThe MrBeast employee, who Kalshi identified as Artem Kaptur in regulatory filings, traded around $4,000 on markets related to the streamer, the company said.\n\nKalshi investigators discovered that Kaptur had \"near-perfect trading success\" on bets about the YouTuber's videos with low odds, making the wagers appear suspicious, according to company officials.\n\nMany people place wagers about MrBeast on Kalshi. People bet hundreds of thousands of dollars on what he will say in his next video. There are markets on the number of subscribers he will bring on this year. And people are betting on when exactly MrBeast will get married.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n![In June, an account on Polymarket correctly predicted military events between Israel and Iran that paid out about $150,000.](https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/427x427+264+0/resize/100/quality/85/format/png/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F35%2F70%2F93440317433b985a8a5ef4882054%2Fpolymarket-charged.png)\n\n### Technology\n\n### Israel accuses two of using military secrets to place Polymarket bets\n\nBut Kalshi investigators say Kaptur was using proximity to the streamer as a way of trying to make quick cash. Using confidential information to manipulate markets is prohibited by Kalshi's rules and could violate federal law.\n\n\"We investigated and found that the trader was employed as an editor for the streamer's show and likely had access to material non-public information connected to his trading,\" said Robert DeNault, the company's head of enforcement.\n\n![Advertisements for Kalshi in New York City predicted a victory for Zohran Mamdani in the city's mayoral election before the votes were counted and polls closed on Nov. 4, 2025.](https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2000x2000+0+0/resize/100/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb8%2F4f%2Fffbfcfe044f593b21b5dff256ffc%2Fap25308712465340.jpg)\n\n### Technology\n\n### Kalshi in court over 19 federal lawsuits. What's the future of prediction markets?\n\nKalshi said the company froze the account in question, so Kaptur was not able to withdraw any profits. He was fined $20,000 and suspended from the platform for two years. Kalshi also said the case was reported to regulators at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or CFTC, which oversees prediction markets like Kalshi.\n\nA spokesman for Beast Industries, MrBeast's company, said it has \"no tolerance\" for insider trading.\n\n\"We have a longstanding policy in place against employees using proprietary company information in order to safeguard the highest standards and ethics throughout our organization,\" the spokesman told NPR, adding that employees are banned from trading on prediction markets in MrBeast-related markets.\n\nThe MrBeast-related trades \"potentially violated\" federal laws against misusing confidential information to manipulate commodity markets, otherwise known as insider trading, according to a statement from the CFTC.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n### Another trading case involved a former political candidate\n\nKalshi also unveiled a case against a former longshot Republican candidate in the California governor's race, Kyle Langford, who posted on X in May that he bet on himself to win the statewide contest. He encouraged others to do the same.\n\n![A billboard in New York City shows a Kalshi advertisement.

People can place bets on these platforms on wide-ranging issues such as what words people say at events, the outcome of elections or how much snow will fall in New York City.\n\n### Business\n\n### They quit their day jobs to bet on current events: A look inside the prediction market\n\nThe explosive growth of the industry is in part driven by the use of what observers many consider a legal loophole, which the Trump administration supports.\n\nInstead of falling under the purview of state gambling laws, prediction markets are regulated in a more obscure way, as a type of \"futures contract,\" overseen by CFTC, which typically regulates bets on the future production of things like soybeans, corn and crude oil.\n\nThe Biden administration fought prediction market apps from listing most types of contracts. It argued there was little public interest value in most of them, not to mention that they invite speculators to manipulate markets through insider trading.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nTrump officials, however, have broken down barriers to allow the industry to thrive, dropping multiple federal investigations into the industry and vowing to battle states that have sued Kalshi for allegedly operating as nothing more than an unlicensed gambling operation.\n\nUntil recently, regulators had allowed a few dozen markets a year for futures trading. Now, there are more than 200,000 active prediction markets.\n\n### Prediction markets stirring increased insider trading fears\n\nThe burgeoning and controversial industry has run headlong into global affairs. In January, a trader made $400,000 in profit on Polymarket by placing a successful bet on the capture of the Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro before there was any public indication that would happen.\n\nEarlier this month, Israeli authorities arrested several people and charged two on suspicion of using classified information to place bets about upcoming military operations in Iran on Polymarket.\n\nInsider trading on Polymarket and Kalshi is prohibited by each platform's rules, and is illegal under federal law, but experts say each company's internal systems can only catch so much insider activity, which can take place by word of mouth or other means outside the prediction market apps.\n\nStill, Kalshi says in the past year it has opened 200 investigations into insider trading, 12 of which are still ongoing.\n\nKalshi said both instances of suspected insider trading revealed on Wednesday have been reported to the CFTC. The company said the fines paid by the two traders will be donated to a non-profit that provides consumer education about derivatives markets.\n\n\"No system is perfect. No financial exchange is immune from bad actors. Not stock exchanges, not banks, not prediction markets,\" said Kalshi's DeNault.\"We're committed to deterring and finding the bad actors, manipulators, and those who willingly cheat.\"\n\n* prediction markets\n* Kalshi\n* mrbeast\n\n* **Facebook**\n* **Flipboard**\n* **Email**",

Share of Ear® from Edison Research is the only audio measurement source that captures how much time Americans spend listening to spoken-word audio sources as well as the platforms they use to do so. This week’s insight focuses on a historic change in how Americans 13+ listen to spoken-word audio daily. In 2015, AM/FM radio accounted for 75% of the time Americans spent with spoken-word audio sources. AM/FM radio was not only the most dominant spoken-word audio listening platform, but it was fully sixty-five percentage points higher than podcasts, which accounted for 10% of listening time back then. Quarter by quarter and year over year, time spent using AM/FM radio to listen to spoken-word audio has declined significantly and shifted to time spent with podcasts. As of Q4 2025, 40% of time spent listening to spoken-word is now spent with podcasts and 39% of time is spent with AM/FM radio. Not only does radio not beat podcasts by a significant margin, it now trails the on-demand platform for spoken-word audio listening. Spoken-word audio has changed dramatically over the past ten years. Consumers now listen using different platforms, devices, and services to engage with spoken-word audio. In addition to capturing how Americans are currently engaging with audio, Share of Ear® also illustrates the seismic changes that occurred in the audio landscape.

Dit was niet de bedoeling, maar het gebeurt nu toch.\n\nMaar het blijkt dat het nog erger kan. DigiD is nog wel van ons, maar het beheer van de computers wordt Amerikaans.\n\nMaar wat nou als je die stap overslaat, en *alles* door Amerikanen laat doen? Dat is wat de belastingdienst nu van plan is met de BTW.\n\n> Heel veel meer hierover is te vinden in dit artikel van Marcel van Kooten op Computable.nl. Aan het einde van deze pagina staan links naar nog meer nieuws hierover in iBestuur, Tweakers, AD en meer.\n\n## Even over de BTW\n\nIedere week komt er zo’n 1,5 miljard euro aan BTW binnen bij de overheid. Dat geld is nodig om de rekeningen te betalen. Als dat geld niet binnenkomt moet de Staat vrij snel bijlenen op de internationale kapitaalmarkt.\n\nDat kan maar tot op zekere hoogte, en daarna komen er grote stukken over je in de Financial Times, het soort stukken wat je niet wil.\n\nDe BTW is dus zeg maar “best belangrijk”.\n\n![](/articles/getty-images-s4daozQHx_E-unsplash.png)\n\n## Wat is het plan nu?\n\nEr was al een Amerikaans softwarebedrijf aangetrokken, FAST Enterprises, voor de vernieuwing van de BTW-verwerking. Dit ging om “off the shelf software” die wel grootschalig aangepast zou moeten worden voor Nederlands gebruik. Daar is al genoeg zorgelijks over te zeggen, en is al een rechtszaak over geweest.\n\nMaar, het blijkt nu dat FAST niet alleen de software levert, ze gaan ook werkelijk *alles* doen.\n\nHoe alles? Uit de aanbesteding:\n\n> Turnkey leveren van een totaaloplossing […] die een klant-tot-klant proces biedt aan [alle]\n> Omzetbelastingregelingen, met inbegrip van Apparatuur, Systeemprogrammatuur en Configuratie,\n> waarnaar de OB Oplossing door Opdrachtnemer in **Onderhoud** en **Beheer** wordt genomen\n> alsmede Opdrachtgever van Support kan voorzien\n\nEr staat hier dus dat FAST niet alleen de software levert, maar ook de servers, en dat de software (op die servers) dus ook onderhouden en beheerd gaat worden door FAST. **En niet door de belastingdienst**. Die mag niet eens zelf inloggen op die servers lijkt het!\n\nHet beheer van de software vindt, op afstand, plaats door het Amerikaanse bedrijf FAST. Nou is dat al heel erg, maar de servers krijgen ook toegang tot de rest van de belastingdienst:\n\n> De verwachting is dat de OB Oplossing gekoppeld moeten worden met 20 tot 25 Applicaties welke actief zijn bij de Belastingdienst.\n\n## De belastingdienst heeft zichzelf hiermee uitbesteed aan FAST Enterprises\n\nDe belastingdienst heeft zelf een omvangrijke computeromgeving, met duizenden medewerkers. Maar, deze mensen hebben niets te maken met het nieuwe BTW-systeem. Dat wordt namelijk gerund door een Amerikaans bedrijf.\n\nWij mogen alleen nog vertellen aan FAST welke bedrijven BTW moeten betalen, en daarna moeten we maar hopen dat ze het goed voor ons gaan regelen allemaal.\n\n## Maar dit is toch te gek voor woorden\n\nWaar dit het meeste op lijkt is “shadow IT”. Shadow IT is als een bedrijfsonderdeel besluit Google Docs te gaan gebruiken voor het werk, en niet de officieel beschikbaar gestelde software voor samenwerking. Microsoft legt hier goed uit hoe onwenselijk dat is.\n\nAls je de aanbestedingsdocumenten goed leest wordt duidelijk dat deze BTW-uitbesteding het best gezien kan worden als shadow IT, die vrijwel geheel buiten de normale IT-afdeling van de belastingdienst heengegaan is.\n\nIn het bovengenoemde stuk op Computable.nl is ook duidelijk te lezen dat deze uitbesteding strijdig is met het beleid van de afdeling IV (=IT) van de belastingdienst. Ik gok dat dit niet hun plan was, en ik betwijfel of ze wel betrokken zijn geweest.\n\n## Waarom wisten we dit niet?\n\nIn de voorlichting aan de Tweede Kamer sprak de belastingdienst steevast over het aanschaffen van *software*. Maar men heeft werkelijk nooit genoemd dat het beheer van die software, en dat van de bijbehorende servers, uitbesteed zou worden aan Amerikanen. De Tweede Kamer is hier mogelijk dus minimaal onvolledig voorgelicht, en mogelijk onjuist.\n\n## Wat kan er misgaan?\n\nDe vraag is meer wat er niet mis kan gaan. Met deze uitbesteding krijgen we nu ‘BTW as a service’ van Amerikanen. Als Trump weer eens dreigt met sancties kunnen ze bij de Dutch State Treasury Agency direct alle verloven intrekken - er zal dan binnenkort anderhalf miljard euro per week bijgeleend moeten gaan worden.\n\nLos daarvan, de FAST Enterprises oplossing zal dus, onder Amerikaans beheer, toegang hebben tot 20 tot 25 andere belastingsystemen. Vol met gegevens van ondernemers en bedrijven. De landsadvocaat heeft eerder bevestigd dat dit betekent dat de Amerikaanse overheid daarmee ook rechtmatig (volgens hun wet) mee mag komen loeren hier.\n\n## Dit moet echt stoppen\n\nDe belastingdienst is al jaren bezig met dit project. Er was al eerder kritiek op. Maar nu de uitrol blijkt in te houden dat we ons hoofd volledig op een Amerikaans hakblok leggen moet het echt gelijk stoppen. In 2026 kan je niet meer je overheid NOG afhankelijker maken van de VS.\n\n### Afsluitende opmerkingen & links\n\nFormeel is de aanbesteding gewonnen door een Nederlandse BV. Maar dat is alleen optisch. Het gaat om FAST Enterprises. Ook is het zo dat de servers in Nederland staan, maar zoals bekend maakt dat weinig uit.\n\nLinks:\n\n* Computable: Belastingdienst vergaloppeert zich met keuze Amerikaanse bouwer omzetbelastingsysteem\n* iBestuur: Hoe de Belastingdienst een potentieel chokepoint creëerde\n* ‘Trump kan ervoor zorgen dat Nederlandse staat geen btw-inkomsten binnenkrijgt’, Tweakers\n* Position paper Herprogrammeer de Overheid t.b.v. rondetafelgesprek Nederlandse Digitaliseringsstrategie (NDS) d.d. 24 september 2025\n* Belastingdienst wil btw-software volledig in Amerikaanse handen leggen: ‘Onbestaanbaar’, Algemeen Dagblad",

I teased, at the end, that I’d been writing science fiction about what life looks like on the other side of that explosion.\n\nThe same day, Citrini Capital published The 2028 Global Intelligence Crisis. A fictional macro memo from June 2028 describing the economic fallout of AI displacing white-collar workers. S&P down 38%. Unemployment at 10.2%. Mortgage market cracking. It’s been everywhere these last few days.\n\nI bring it up because it’s the same starting conditions as what I’ve been writing about and exploring. Same premise. Very different place to stand while you look at it.\n\nThe Citrini piece counts the jobs lost. It models the displacement spiral: AI gets good, companies cut headcount, spending collapses, the feedback loop accelerates. If you only count the jobs that disappear, the math is brutal.\n\nI’ve been more focused on the new jobs that will be created.\n\n---\n\nBasically since I created it with Claude, I’ve been clicking around the Traffic Jam Explorer. Sometimes I would get stuck on some of the leaps from node -> second order effect -> traffic jam -> new role. The abstractions too abstract. So I started asking Claude to just write me a short story about a day in the life of someone doing one of these jobs. Show me what it actually *means* for a person to be a “Computational Experience Reviewer” on a random afternoon.\n\nWhat came back was surprisingly useful, fiction as a *thinking tool*. The stories made the abstractions concrete in a way the tree in the Traffic Jam Explorer couldn’t. I started using them to reason through all types of AI-related problems I’d been kicking around with friends, and the narratives kept unlocking angles my analysis alone missed. Protocolized has been doing something like this with their protocol fiction work for a while now, and this exercise finally made it click for me that fiction can let you stress-test ideas or get a better sense of them by making them live somewhere you can imagine.\n\nSo I built it a home to share the best of it with you all.\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yXRs!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd2c0a197-b738-46af-87ff-6d9044b604dd_1024x1024.png)\n\n**Near Zero**: weekly short stories, set in a world where the cost of building software has collapsed. New professions, new problems, new people navigating what comes after the disruption everyone keeps modeling. If all goes according to plan, I’ll also collect the stories into an ebook on Kindle at the end of each month.\n\nThe first piece is called *The Executable Muse* and it looks at a day in the life of a “Senior Computational Experience Reviewer” and the rise of software as content. I think you’ll all really enjoy it.\n\nWorks On My Machine continues as usual with open source and other projects, me building and thinking in public. You can think of Near Zero as a companion to this newsletter and expect to see some of the inventions in that world get built and launched here.\n\n**Subscribe to Near Zero →** to catch the first post going out in about a week!\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\nShare",
