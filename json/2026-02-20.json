The background is a slightly desaturated Brazilian flag.](https://i0.wp.com/craphound.com/images/brazil-corporate-veil.jpg?w=840&ssl=1)\n\n# A perforated corporate veil (permalink)\n\n\"Capitalist realism\" is the idea that the world's current economic and political arrangements are inevitable, and that any attempt to alter them is a) irrational; b) doomed; and c) dangerous. It's the ideology of Margaret Thatcher's maxim, \"There is no alternative.\"\n\nObviously this is very convenient if you are a current beneficiary of the status quo. \"There is no alternative\" is a thought-stopping demand dressed up as an observation. It means, \"Don't try and think of alternatives.\"\n\nThe thing is, alternatives *already exist* and work very well. The Mondragon co-ops in Spain constitute a fully worked out, long-term stable economic alternative to traditional capitalist enterprises, employing more than 100,000 people and generating tangible, empirically measured benefits to workers, customers and the region:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondragon\\_Corporation\n\nProponents of capitalist realism will tell you that Mondragon doesn't count. Maybe it's just a one-off. Or maybe it's just not big enough. 100,000 workers sounds like a lot, but Amazon has over 1.5m employees and untold numbers of misclassified contractors who are employees in everything but name (and legal rights).\n\nThis is some pretty transparent goalpost moving, but sure, let's stipulate that Mondragon doesn't prove that there are broadly applicable alternatives to the dominant capitalism of the mid-2020s. Are there other examples of \"an alternative?\"\n\nThere sure are.\n\nLet's look at limited liability. Limited liability – the idea that a company's shareholders cannot be held liable for the company's misdeeds – is a bedrock of capitalist dogma. The story goes that until the advent of the \"joint stock enterprise\" (and its handmaiden, limited liability) there was no efficient way to do \"capital formation\" (raising money for a project or business).\n\nBecause of this, the only ambitious, capital-intensive projects were those that caught the fancy of a king, a Pope, or an aristocrat. But once limited liability appears on the scene, many people of modest means can jointly invest in a project without worrying about being bankrupted if it turns out that the people running it are crooks or bumblers. That lets you, say, buy a single share of a company without having to keep daily tabs on the management's every action without worrying that if they go wrong, someone they've hurt will sue you for everything you've got.\n\nCapital formation is a real thing, and limited liability unquestionably facilitates capital formation. There are plenty of good things in the world that exist because limited liability protections allowed everyday people to help bring them into existence. This isn't just stuff that makes a lot of money for capitalism's true believers, it includes everything from the company that makes the printing presses that your favorite anarchist zine runs on to the mill that makes the alloys for the e-bike you use to get to a demonstration.\n\nThis is where capitalist realism comes in. Capitalist realists will claim that there is no way to do capital formation for these beneficial goods without limited liability – and not just *any* limited liability, but *maximum* limited liability in which the \"corporate veil\" can never be pierced to assign culpability to any shareholder. The capitalist realist claim is that the corporate veil is like the skin of a balloon, and that any attempt to poke even the smallest hole in it will cause it to rupture and vanish.\n\nBut this just isn't true, and we can tell, because one of the largest economies in the world has operated with a perforated corporate veil for nearly a century, and that economy hasn't suffered from capital formation problems. Quite the contrary, some of the world's largest (and most destructive) monopolies are headquartered in this country where the veil of limited liability is thoroughly perforated.\n\nThe country I'm talking about is Brazil, which has had *limited* limited liability since *1937*:\n\nhttps://lpeproject.org/blog/when-workers-pierce-the-corporate-veil-brazils-forgotten-innovation/\n\nAs Mariana Pargendler writes for the *LPE Project*, Brazil put limits on limited liability to address a common pattern of corporate abuse. Companies would set up in Brazil, incur a lot of liabilities (say, by poisoning the land, water and air, or by stealing from or maiming workers), and then, when the wheels of justice caught up with them, the companies would fold and re-establish themselves the next day under a new name.\n\nLike I say, this happens all over the world. It's incredibly common, and even the pettiest of crooks know how to use this trick. I know someone whose NYC apartment was flooded by the upstairs neighbor, who decided that they didn't need to worry about the fact that their toilet wouldn't stop running – for months, until the walls of the apartment downstairs dissolved in a slurry of black mold. The upstairs neighbor owned the apartment through an LLC, which they simply folded up and walked away from, while my friend was stuck with a giant bill and no one to sue.\n\nThe limited liability company is the scammer's best friend. In the UK, an anti-tax extremist invented a tax-evasion scam whereby landlords pretend that their empty commercial buildings are tax-exempt \"snail farms\" by scattering around some boxes with a few snails in them:\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/posts/149255928?collection=1941093\n\nWhen this results in inevitable stonking fines and adverse judgments, the \"snail farmers\" duck liability by folding up their limited liability company after transferring its assets to a new LLC.\n\nCapitalist realists will tell you that this is just the price of efficient capital formation. Without total, airtight limited liability – the sort that allows for this kind of obvious, petty ripoff – no one would be able to raise capital for *anything*.\n\nBrazil begs to differ. In 1937, Brazil made parent companies liable for their subsidiaries' obligations, with a system of \"joint and several liability\" for LLCs. This was expanded with 1943's Consolidation of Labor Laws, and it worked so well that the Brazilian legislature expanded it again in 2017.\n\nRemember back in 2024, when Elon Musk defied a Brazilian court order about Twitter, only to have Brazil freeze *Starlink's* assets until Musk caved? That was the \"joint and several\" liability system:\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/13/world/americas/brazil-musk-x-starlink.html\n\nAs Pargendler writes, Brazil's liability system \"represented a distributive choice: prioritizing Brazilian workers’ ability to enforce their rights over foreign capital’s interest in minimizing costs through corporate structuring.\"\n\nPargendler (who teaches at Harvard Law) co-authored a paper with São Paulo Law's Olívia Pasqualeto analyzing the impact that Brazil's limited liability system had on capital formation and corporate conduct:\n\nhttps://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\\_id=6105586\n\nUnsurprisingly, they find that there has been a steady pressure to erode the joint and several system, but also that some countries (the US and France) have a \"joint employer\" doctrine that is a weak form of this. Portugal, meanwhile, adopted the Brazilian system, 70 years after Brazil – this transposition of law from a former colony to a former colonial power is apparently called \"reverse convergence\":\n\nhttps://lpeproject.org/blog/heterodox-corporate-laws-in-the-global-south/\n\nMore countries in the global south have adopted regimes similar to Brazil's, like Venezuela and Chile. Other countries go further, like Mozambique and Angola. Somewhere in between are other Latin American countries like Peru and Uruguay, where these rules have entered practice through judicial rulings, not legislation.\n\nThe authors don't claim that perforating the corporate veil solves all the problems of exploitative, fraudulent or corrupt corporate conduct. Rather, they're challenging the capitalist realist doctrine that insists that this system couldn't possibly exist, and if it did, it would be a disaster.\n\nA hundred years of Brazilian law, and Brazil's globe-spanning corporate giants, beg to differ.\n\n(*Image: Gage Skidmore, CC BY-SA 2.0, modified*)\n\n---\n\n# Hey look at this (permalink)\n\n![](https://i0.wp.com/craphound.com/images/heylookatthis3.jpg?w=840&ssl=1)\n\n* Rep.

    "content": "![Book cover.](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/9781407011035-jacket-large.webp)\n\nThis is a curious and mostly charming book about therapy. It is presented as a (somewhat contrived) Socratic dialogue between Skynner the teacher and Cleese the pupil. Skynner lectures on while Cleese interjects with \"that's too clever to be convincing\" and other witty remarks. It is fun to have a somewhat sceptical interlocutor but it does get a little wearisome after a while.\n\nThe basic of the premise is much the same as Larkin's \"This Be The Verse\". We all have various neuroses and blockers that wall off parts of our personalities. These prevent us from living our best lives and are often (inadvertently) reinforced by our families and spouses. The solution? Go to therapy and take your family with you!\n\nSome of the notions within the book are a little outdated. The stuff about homosexuality and \"trans-sexuals\" probably doesn't stand up to modern scrutiny. They're neither cruel nor callous when discussing it, and seem to agree that so-called conversion will do more harm than good. Similarly, while not *excruciatingly* sexist, it is a bit painfully blokey. The constant whinging about \"women’s libbers\" doesn't help - nor the stuff about Cleese hitting his daughter - and the book would have been better if anyone other than a PSM had been involved.\n\nStill, for a book written in 1983 there are some terrifyingly modern predictions within its pages:\n\n> **John**:  You mean a politician who’s been a rebel all his life might find it difficult to be sufficiently firm if he ever got put in a position of power?\n>\n> **Robin**:  Either that, or else he’d become very authoritarian but pretend that all his decisions were really being made democratically, on behalf of the silent majority perhaps, or the proletariat.\n\nI can't think of *anyone* like that. Can you?\n\nSimilarly, the book is rather good at turning its ire onto groups of people:\n\n> **John**:  So if we look at mainstream British politics, it’s perfectly healthy that the parties should get worked up and angry with each other during a debate or an election, because they can let those feelings go later and talk to each other on a friendly basis.\n>\n> **Robin**:  Yes. After all, politics is the art of the possible, isn’t it? No one’s going to have exactly the same views, so you need to respect each other’s differences and try to reach a reasonable compromise if you can.\n>\n> **John**:  But the real extremists have difficulty with this, don’t they? They don’t seem to be able to see their political opponents as people who happen to hold different opinions. They really seem to view them as bad people.\n>\n> **Robin**:  Well, you see, people like this need to use their opponents as dustbins, somewhere they can dump all the bits of themselves that they can’t accept. Just like the scapegoat in a sick family. So they need to hate their opponents to keep themselves sane.\n\nDo you feel seen?\n\nLike lots of books, it is very keen on diagnosing the problem but slightly hazy about providing the solution. There aren't any exercises to do or worksheets to fill in. I think it is assumed that anyone reading the book will recognise themselves in the pages and immediately pick up the Yellow Pages to find a therapist.\n\nOn a technical level, it is disappointing that the cartoon illustrations are extremely low resolution and blurry. There's also no alt text. That said, they're a bit naff; so you aren't missing out on much.\n\nAn interesting enough curio, but there are probably more rigorous and useful books out there.\n\n| Verdict |\n| --- |\n| ★★⯪☆☆

The first in the Gemini 3.1 series, priced the same as Gemini 3 Pro ($2/million input, $12/million output under 200,000 tokens, $4/$18 for 200,000 to 1,000,000). That's less than half the price of Claude Opus 4.6 with very similar benchmark scores to that model.\n\nThey boast about its improved SVG animation performance compared to Gemini 3 Pro in the announcement!\n\nI tried \"Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle\" in Google AI Studio and it thought for 323.9 seconds (thinking trace here) before producing this one:\n\n![Whimsical flat-style illustration of a pelican wearing a blue and white baseball cap, riding a red bicycle with yellow-rimmed wheels along a road. The pelican has a large orange bill and a green scarf. A small fish peeks out of a brown basket on the handlebars. The background features a light blue sky with a yellow sun, white clouds, and green hills.](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/gemini-3.1-pro-pelican.png)\n\nIt's good to see the legs clearly depicted on both sides of the frame (should satisfy Elon), the fish in the basket is a nice touch and I appreciated this comment in the SVG code:\n\n```\n<!-- Black Flight Feathers on Wing Tip -->\n<path d=\"M 420 175 C 440 182, 460 187, 470 190 C 450 210, 430 208, 410 198 Z\" fill=\"#374151\" />\n```\n\nI've added the two new model IDs `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` and `gemini-3.1-pro-preview-customtools` to my llm-gemini plugin for LLM. That \"custom tools\" one is described here - apparently it may provide better tool performance than the default model in some situations.\n\nThe model appears to be *incredibly* slow right now - it took 104s to respond to a simple \"hi\" and a few of my other tests met \"Error: This model is currently experiencing high demand. Spikes in demand are usually temporary. Please try again later.\" or \"Error: Deadline expired before operation could complete\" errors. I'm assuming that's just teething problems on launch day.\n\nIt sounds like last week's Deep Think release was our first exposure to the 3.1 family:\n\n> Last week, we released a major update to Gemini 3 Deep Think to solve modern challenges across science, research and engineering. Today, we’re releasing the upgraded core intelligence that makes those breakthroughs possible: Gemini 3.1 Pro.\n\n**Update**: In What happens if AI labs train for pelicans riding bicycles? last November I said:\n\n> If a model finally comes out that produces an excellent SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle you can bet I’m going to test it on all manner of creatures riding all sorts of transportation devices.\n\nGoogle's Gemini Lead Jeff Dean tweeted this video featuring an animated pelican riding a bicycle, plus a frog on a penny-farthing and a giraffe driving a tiny car and an ostrich on roller skates and a turtle kickflipping a skateboard and a dachshund driving a stretch limousine.\n\n[![\n\n](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/gemini-animated-pelicans.jpg)](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/gemini-animated-pelicans.mp4)\n\nI've been saying for a while that I wish AI labs would highlight things that their new models can do that their older models could not, so top marks to the Gemini team for this video.\n\n**Update 2**: I used `llm-gemini` to run my more detailed Pelican prompt, with this result:\n\n![Flat-style illustration of a brown pelican riding a teal bicycle with dark blue-rimmed wheels against a plain white background. Unlike the previous image's white cartoon pelican, this pelican has realistic brown plumage with detailed feather patterns, a dark maroon head, yellow eye, and a large pink-tinged pouch bill. The bicycle is a simpler design without a basket, and the scene lacks the colorful background elements like the sun, clouds, road, hills, cap, and scarf from the first illustration, giving it a more minimalist feel.](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/gemini-3.1-pro-pelican-2.png)\n\nFrom the SVG comments:\n\n```\n<!-- Pouch Gradient (Breeding Plumage: Red to Olive/Green) -->\n...\n<!-- Neck Gradient (Breeding Plumage: Chestnut Nape, White/Yellow Front) -->\n```\n\nPosted 19th February 2026 at 5:58 pm\n\n## Recent articles\n\n* Two new Showboat tools: Chartroom and datasette-showboat - 17th February 2026\n* Deep Blue - 15th February 2026\n* The evolution of OpenAI's mission statement - 13th February 2026\n\nThis is a **link post** by Simon Willison, posted on 19th February 2026.\n\ngoogle\n397\n\nsvg\n52\n\nai\n1856\n\ngenerative-ai\n1643\n\nllms\n1608\n\nllm\n249\n\ngemini\n129\n\npelican-riding-a-bicycle\n97\n\nllm-release\n179\n\n### Monthly briefing\n\nSponsor me for **$10/month** and get a curated email digest of the month's most important LLM developments.\n\nPay me to send you less!\n\nSponsor & subscribe\n\n* Disclosures\n* Colophon\n* ©\n* 2002\n* 2003\n* 2004\n* 2005\n* 2006\n* 2007\n* 2008\n* 2009\n* 2010\n* 2011\n* 2012\n* 2013\n* 2014\n* 2015\n* 2016\n* 2017\n* 2018\n* 2019\n* 2020\n* 2021\n* 2022\n* 2023\n* 2024\n* 2025\n* 2026",

announced that a select number of races will be shown live in IMAX locations across the United States in 2026.\n\nThe new fan viewing experience is part of a collaboration with Apple TV, which has taken over the broadcasting rights for the championship in the US on a multi-year deal from 2026.\n\n“F1 is a rapidly growing force in sports and culture in the US, and by bringing F1 on Apple TV live to IMAX theatres nationwide, we’re delivering the energy and excitement to even more screens in a truly immersive way,” said Oliver Schusser, Apple’s vice president of music, sports, and Beats.\n\n“We’re excited to collaborate with IMAX to expand access to F1 on Apple TV and give fans across the U.S. a powerful new way to experience the speed and spectacle that the sport delivers.”\n\nThe announcement also follows the monumental success of the *F1* movie, which was directed by Joseph Kosinski, produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and starred Brad Pitt.\n\n“Apple TV and Joe Kosinski’s brilliant *F1: The Movie* proved beyond a doubt that the speed, precision, and artistry of Formula 1 translate beautifully to the IMAX Experience, and we are very excited to further our collaboration with Apple and offer fans more of what resonated so deeply with that film by presenting live F1 races to them in IMAX,” said Jonathan Fischer, chief content officer at IMAX.\n\n“As we continue to expand our global content portfolio with awe-inspiring experiences, we look forward to working with Apple to amplify its live coverage of Formula 1 and give fans in the U.S. an all-new way to experience this fast-growing sport.”\n\n![Starting grid](//cdn.motorsport.com/images/mgl/2wBNede0/s1000/starting-grid.jpg) \n\nStarting grid\n\nPhoto by: Sam Bloxham / LAT Images via Getty

    "content": "**ActivityPub** is a federated protocol used by public houses in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland for announcing scheduled events, drink promotions, and community activities to patrons and the wider neighbourhood. Each participating pub operates as an independent **instance**, maintaining its own chalkboard and event schedule while optionally sharing activity information with other instances in the network. First formalised in the early 18th century, the protocol remains in widespread use today, with an estimated 46,000 active instances across the British Isles as of 2024.1\n\nThe broader network of interconnected pubs implementing the protocol is colloquially known as the **fediverse** (a portmanteau of “federated” and “diverse,” referring to the range of establishments involved, from village locals to central London gastropubs). Individual participants in the protocol are referred to as **actors**, a category that includes landlords, bar staff, and in some implementations, particularly opinionated regulars.2\n\n## Etymology\n\nThe term derives from the compound of “activity” (from Latin *activitas*, meaning “a doing”) and “pub” (a contraction of “public house”). The earliest known written use appears in a 1714 licensing petition from a Southwark innkeeper requesting permission to “maintain an Activity Pub board of not less than three feet in width” outside his premises.3 Earlier informal references to “the activity of the pub” appear in parish records from the 1680s, though scholars debate whether these constitute use of the compound noun or merely coincidental adjacency.4\n\n## History\n\n### Origins\n\nPrior to formalisation, British pubs communicated their activities through a variety of ad hoc methods, including town criers, word of mouth, and what the brewing historian Margaret Eaves has termed “aggressive loitering” — the practice of landlords standing in doorways and shouting at passers-by.5 The lack of standardisation led to significant confusion. A 1702 pamphlet from the Borough of Lewes describes a man who attended three consecutive funerals at The King’s Head under the impression they were cheese tastings, the landlord’s handwriting being “of such character as to render all notices indistinguishable.”6\n\n### Chalkboard era (1714–1980s)\n\nThe Publican Notices Act of 1714 required all licensed premises to maintain a visible board, specifying chalk on dark-painted board but no format. Historians call the resulting chaos the “Great Inconsistency” — a period in which no two instances in England announced events in the same way.7\n\nSome publicans listed events chronologically. Others grouped them by type. A celebrated board at The Lamb and Flag in Oxford listed everything alphabetically, meaning that “Arm Wrestling (Tuesdays)” perpetually appeared above “Wednesday Pie Night,” causing regulars to arrive on the wrong day with a frequency that the landlord described in his diary as “unwavering.”8\n\n### The Federation Question\n\nBy the mid-19th century, the growth of brewery-owned tied houses created pressure for a more consistent protocol. In 1872, the United Brewers’ Federation published *Recommendations for the Uniform Display of Pub Activities*, the first formal specification. The document established conventions still recognisable today: the use of a header line identifying the instance, a chronological listing of weekly events, and the now-ubiquitous phrase “ALL WELCOME” at the bottom, regardless of whether this was true.9\n\nThe specification was not universally adopted. Free houses resisted what they termed “the tyranny of federation,” and several publicans in the West Country continued to announce events exclusively through the medium of poetry well into the 1920s. A board outside The Bell in Frome reportedly read, in its entirety: “Come Thursday next for song and ale / The pork will not be stale.”10\n\nThe question of **defederation** — the deliberate severing of communication between instances — first arose during this period. A group of temperance-adjacent pubs in Birmingham refused to acknowledge or relay event information from establishments they considered excessively rowdy, a practice that the publicans of Digbeth described as “the cold shoulder, applied at institutional scale.”11 The practice persists today; a 2023 survey found that 12% of pubs actively defederate from at least one neighbouring instance, most commonly over noise complaints, poaching of quiz teams, or “personal reasons the landlord declined to elaborate on.”12\n\n### Digital transition\n\nThe introduction of social media in the early 21st century created a schism in the ActivityPub community. A faction of publicans, predominantly in urban areas, began duplicating their chalkboard announcements on Facebook and Instagram, leading to what the *Morning Advertiser* described in 2016 as “a crisis of protocol.”13 Traditionalists argued that the canonical source of pub activity information must remain the physical board, and that digital copies were inherently unreliable due to the tendency of pub social media accounts to also post photographs of dogs and unsolicited opinions about the weather.\n\nThe controversy intensified when several landlords began **boosting** — the practice of reproducing another pub’s activity announcements on one’s own board, typically to alert followers of events at nearby instances. While some viewed this as a natural extension of the federated model, others considered it a breach of etiquette. A landlord in Stoke Newington was reportedly barred from three neighbouring pubs in 2019 after boosting their curry night announcements with the annotation “OURS IS BETTER.”14\n\nIn 2018, the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA) published a position paper titled *ActivityPub: Preserving the Chalkboard Standard*, which argued that the physical board remained “the only trustworthy and fully decentralised method of communicating pub activities,” noting that it required no internet connection, could not be algorithmically suppressed, and was resistant to outages except in cases of rain or vandalism.15\n\n## Protocol specification\n\n### Actors\n\nThe protocol defines three categories of **actor**:\n\n* **Instance administrators** (landlords and landladies): responsible for maintaining the board, scheduling activities, and exercising moderation powers including the authority to **block** disruptive patrons.\n* **Staff actors**: permitted to update the board on behalf of the administrator, though in practice often reluctant to do so on grounds that “it’s not my handwriting” or “I wasn’t told we’d stopped doing Wednesdays.”\n* **Followers** (regulars): actors who have established a persistent relationship with a specific instance. A patron becomes a follower through repeated attendance; no formal subscription mechanism exists, though some pubs maintain a mailing list which nobody reads.16\n\nThe question of **account migration** — the process by which a follower transfers their primary allegiance from one instance to another — is considered one of the most socially fraught aspects of the protocol. Etiquette varies by region, but it is generally understood that a regular who begins frequenting a different pub should not be seen doing so by staff of the former instance, particularly if the new one is visible from the old one.17\n\n### Inbox and outbox\n\nEach instance maintains two conceptual message stores:\n\n* The **outbox**: the externally facing chalkboard, A-board, or other display visible to the public. This is the primary publication mechanism of the protocol.\n* The **inbox**: traditionally a physical letterbox, noticeboard, or corner of the bar where community notices, band flyers, and unsolicited offers of DJ services accumulate. The inbox is write-only in practice; items deposited there are seldom read by the instance administrator and are periodically discarded in bulk during cleaning.18\n\nMessage delivery between instances occurs through a process known as **inbox forwarding**, in which a patron who has seen an activity announced at one pub mentions it at another. The reliability of this mechanism depends entirely on the patron’s memory, sobriety, and willingness to relay information accurately. Studies suggest a message corruption rate of approximately 40% per hop, rising to 70% after 10pm.19\n\n### Format\n\nWhile no single format is mandated, the *de facto* standard for a compliant ActivityPub board includes the following elements:\n\n* **Header**: The name of the instance, often rendered in a larger or more decorative hand than the body text.\n* **Body**: A chronological list of upcoming activities, typically covering the current week.\n* **Footer**: A welcoming statement and/or the price of the current guest ale.\n\nActivities are generally expressed as a tuple of day, time, and event name, e.g. “THURSDAY 8PM — QUIZ NIGHT.” The use of exclamation marks is permitted but discouraged by CAMRA guidelines, which state that “the activities of a well-run pub should speak for themselves.”20\n\nAn early attempt to introduce a structured notation for chalkboard content, known as **JSON-LD** (Joint Standardised Notation for Leisure Displays), was proposed by a committee of the British Beer and Pub Association in 2004. The notation required events to be written in a rigid format with bracketed metadata: “[TYPE:quiz][DAY:thu][TIME:20:00] QUIZ NIGHT.” It was trialled at four pubs in Reading and abandoned within a week after staff refused to use it on grounds that it “looked like someone had a stroke while writing the board.”21\n\n### Content warnings\n\nSome instances prepend **content warnings** to specific activity announcements, alerting patrons to potentially divisive content. Common content warnings include “karaoke,” “DJ Dave,” “under-12s welcome,” and “the landlord’s band.” CAMRA guidelines suggest that content warnings should be used “sparingly and only where the nature of the activity might cause a patron to make alternative plans,” though in practice the mere presence of a content warning has been shown to increase attendance by 15%, curiosity being more powerful than caution.22\n\n### WebFinger\n\nThe **WebFinger** protocol provides a mechanism for identifying which instance a given actor is primarily associated with. In its traditional implementation, a patron entering an unfamiliar pub would ask a member of staff, “Do you know [name]?” — a lookup request that, if successful, would return the actor’s home instance (e.g., “Oh, Dave? He’s usually at The Crown on Thursdays”). The protocol is named for the physical gesture that typically accompanies the response: a pointed finger indicating the direction of the referenced establishment.23\n\nWebFinger queries are subject to privacy considerations. A 2019 CAMRA position paper noted that “no patron should be identifiable to a third party through their pub associations without prior consent,” though it acknowledged that in villages with populations under 500, the protocol was “largely redundant, everyone already knowing where everyone drinks and, frequently, how much.”24\n\n### Supported activity types\n\nThe protocol supports an effectively unlimited range of activity types, though analysis of 12,000 instances conducted by the University of Sheffield in 2019 found that 94% of all announced activities fell into one of the following categories:25\n\n| Activity | Frequency |\n| --- | --- |\n| Quiz night | 89% |\n| Live music (unspecified) | 72% |\n| Curry night | 54% |\n| Open mic | 41% |\n| Meat raffle | 38% |\n| Pub quiz (distinct from quiz night, for reasons that remain unclear) | 27% |\n| Karaoke | 24% |\n| Bingo | 19% |\n| “Live Sport” | 18% |\n| Psychic night | 4% |\n\nThe study noted that “psychic night” appeared almost exclusively in pubs in the North West of England, and that none of them had predicted the study’s findings.25\n\n### Interoperability\n\nInteroperability between instances remains a challenge. A 2022 trial at a Wetherspoons in Basingstoke attempted to introduce machine-readable QR codes linking to event listings, but was abandoned after three weeks when it was discovered that the code linked to the pub’s 2017 menu and nobody had noticed.26\n\nSeveral alternative implementations of the protocol have emerged over the years. **The Mastodon** (a pub in Finsbury Park, London) briefly operated a system in which events were announced by means of a large brass horn mounted above the door, sounded at 500-character intervals. Complaints from neighbours led to the horn’s removal in 2017, though the pub continues to operate a compliant ActivityPub instance using conventional chalk.27\n\n## Governance\n\nActivityPub has no single governing body. CAMRA publishes advisory guidelines, and the British Beer and Pub Association maintains a best-practice document, but compliance is voluntary. A **W3C** (Wessex, Wales, and Cornwall Committee) working group was established in 2015 to develop a formal standard but was dissolved in 2018 after failing to reach consensus on whether “happy hour” constituted an activity or a pricing policy.28\n\nIn practice, the protocol is governed by what the sociologist Dennis Ethernet has called “the distributed authority of regulars” — a system in which factual errors on a pub’s activity board are corrected not by any formal mechanism but by a patron mentioning it to the landlord, who may or may not act on the information depending on whether they are busy, whether they can find the chalk, and whether they consider the error material.29\n\nInstance **moderation** is handled exclusively by the landlord or designated staff. Moderation actions include verbal warnings, temporary suspensions (“you’ve had enough, come back tomorrow”), and permanent blocks, colloquially known as “barrings.” Unlike digital implementations, there is no appeals process, though a blocked actor may submit an informal unblock request by appearing contrite and buying the administrator a drink.30\n\n## Criticism\n\nCritics have noted that the ActivityPub protocol suffers from several persistent issues:\n\n* **Ambiguity**: The phrase “Live Music Saturday” does not specify genre, start time, volume, or whether the performer is the landlord’s nephew.31\n* **Chalk supply chain issues**: During the COVID-19 pandemic, several pubs reported difficulty obtaining chalk, though it was noted that this was the least of their problems.32\n* **Discovery**: New patrons report difficulty locating active instances, particularly in rural areas where pubs may not be visible from main roads. The protocol provides no native discovery mechanism beyond “walking around and looking.”33\n\n## Cultural significance\n\nThe ActivityPub board has been described as “the last surviving commons of British civic life”34 and “a chalkboard outside a pub.”35 Its persistence in the digital age has been attributed variously to tradition, the aesthetic appeal of chalk lettering, the unreliability of pub Wi-Fi, and the fact that most instance administrators are too busy to maintain a website.\n\nThe term **toot** ...",

And nobody had ever tweeted from a Commodore VIC-20, the best selling computer of 1982, before. Syd Bolton, the curator of the Canadian Personal Computer Museum, decided to fix that. And on February 20, 2010, a VIC-20 tweeted.\n\n## Tweeting from a Commodore VIC-20\n\n![Allsop 30336 with Commodore VIC-20](https://i0.wp.com/dfarq.homeip.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/allsop-30336-commodore-vic20.jpg?resize=266%2C300&ssl=1)\n\nA Commodore VIC-20 with a modem cost about $330 in 1982, making it the least expensive way to get online. So it made sense to eventually use one to send a tweet in the 21st century.\n\nBolton wrote a program called TweeVER, which stands for Tweeting from a Vintage Computer. Stored on a cassette, TweeVER connected a VIC-20 to the Internet and allowed it to tweet, and it fit in a stock, unexpanded VIC-20 with 3.5 kilobytes of usable memory. That’s *kilo*bytes. Not megabytes and not gigabytes.\n\n“For me, it was an engineering experiment. Taking a computer that was almost 30 years old and integrating it into modern society was all the drive I needed,” Bolton said at the time.\n\nThe VIC-20 was an underpowered machine even when it was first released in 1981. It was the first computer with color to sell for less than $300, but it took some compromises to get to that price point. It could only display 22 columns of text, had a 1 MHz processor, and was intended to connect to a portable television for a display. Commodore made a disk drive for it but it cost $500, considerably more than the computer itself. So most purchasers opted for a $70 cassette drive that used audio cassette tapes to store programs and data instead.\n\n### Why tweeting from a VIC-20 was fitting\n\nIn 1982, Commodore did release an inexpensive modem for the VIC-20, the first modem to retail for less than $100. A VIC-20 plus a VICmodem cost less than some competing modems all alone. In its Christmas 1982 catalog, Montgomery Ward sold the VIC-20 for $229 and the modem for $99. The combination was the least expensive way to get online in 1982, so it provided tens of thousands of consumers in the early 1980s with their first introduction to telecommunications.\n\nThe stereotype of a hacker/phone phreaker/software pirate with a cheap Commodore and modem became cliche by the late 1980s, but it all started with the VIC-20 and the VICmodem in 1982.\n\nBecause of the VIC-20’s unique place in history, tweeting from one at least once seems oddly appropriate, in addition to the immense technical challenge.\n\n## Making the tweet happen\n\nOn Saturday, February 20, 2010 at approximately 11:06 AM, journalist Richard Beales sat down at a VIC-20 at the Canadian Personal Computer Museum and sent a tweet, making the VIC-20 the oldest computer to ever tweet.\n\nUnfortunately, I wasn’t able to find a copy of the tweet. The Canadian Personal Computer Museum’s feed only goes back to 2011. And even though coverage of the event from the time exists, none of them contained a screenshot of the tweet, unfortunately.\n\nOf course today, we’d probably connect the VIC-20 up to Bluesky instead. I’d argue the VIC-20 is more relevant in 2026 than Twitter is now, and the golden age of microblogging a couple hundred characters at a time is probably over. On November 23, 2025, Twitter added a feature showing where accounts originate from, and revealed that about 70% of political influencers on Twitter were not based in the country they claimed to be. The feature vanished after two hours once the data proved inconvenient to the current owner of Twitter.\n\nIf you found this post informative or helpful, please share it!\n\n* share\n* share\n* save\n* share\n* share\n* share\n* pocket\n* share\n* email\n* RSS feed\n\n![](https://i0.wp.com/dfarq.homeip.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/dave_farquhar_181px.jpg?resize=100%2C100&ssl=1)![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20100%20100%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\nDave Farquhar\n\nDavid Farquhar is a computer security professional, entrepreneur, and author.
