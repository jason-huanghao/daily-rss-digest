Learn more\n\n21st February 2026\n\n**Andrej Karpathy talks about \"Claws\"**. Andrej Karpathy tweeted a mini-essay about buying a Mac Mini (\"The apple store person told me they are selling like hotcakes and everyone is confused\") to tinker with Claws:\n\n> I'm definitely a bit sus'd to run OpenClaw specifically [...] But I do love the concept and I think that just like LLM agents were a new layer on top of LLMs, Claws are now a new layer on top of LLM agents, taking the orchestration, scheduling, context, tool calls and a kind of persistence to a next level.\n>\n> Looking around, and given that the high level idea is clear, there are a lot of smaller Claws starting to pop out.

I just turned on a new feature I’m calling “beats” (after story beats, naming this was hard!) which adds five new types of content to my site, all corresponding to activity elsewhere.\n\nHere’s what beats look like:\n\n![Screenshot of a fragment of a page showing three entries from 30th Dec 2025. First: [RELEASE] \"datasette-turnstile 0.1a0 — Configurable CAPTCHAs for Datasette paths usin…\" at 7:23 pm. Second: [TOOL] \"Software Heritage Repository Retriever — Download archived Git repositories f…\" at 11:41 pm. Third: [TIL] \"Downloading archived Git repositories from archive.softwareheritage.org — …\" at 11:43 pm.](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/three-beats.jpg)\n\nThose three are from the 30th December 2025 archive page.\n\nBeats are little inline links with badges that fit into different content timeline views around my site, including the homepage, search and archive pages.\n\nThere are currently five types of beats:\n\n* Releases are GitHub releases of my many different open source projects, imported from this JSON file that was constructed by GitHub Actions.\n* TILs are the posts from my TIL blog, imported using a SQL query over JSON and HTTP against the Datasette instance powering that site.\n* Museums are new posts on my niche-museums.com blog, imported from this custom JSON feed.\n* Tools are HTML and JavaScript tools I’ve vibe-coded on my tools.simonwillison.net site, as described in Useful patterns for building HTML tools.\n* Research is for AI-generated research projects, hosted in my simonw/research repo and described in Code research projects with async coding agents like Claude Code and Codex.\n\nThat’s five different custom integrations to pull in all of that data. The good news is that this kind of integration project is the kind of thing that coding agents *really* excel at. I knocked most of the feature out in a single morning while working in parallel on various other things.\n\nI didn’t have a useful structured feed of my Research projects, and it didn’t matter because I gave Claude Code a link to the raw Markdown README that lists them all and it spun up a parser regex. Since I’m responsible for both the source and the destination I’m fine with a brittle solution that would be too risky against a source that I don’t control myself.\n\nClaude also handled all of the potentially tedious UI integration work with my site, making sure the new content worked on all of my different page types and was handled correctly by my faceted search engine.\n\n#### Prototyping with Claude Artifacts\n\nI actually prototyped the initial concept for beats in regular Claude—not Claude Code—taking advantage of the fact that it can clone public repos from GitHub these days. I started with:\n\n> `Clone simonw/simonwillisonblog and tell me about the models and views`\n\nAnd then later in the brainstorming session said:\n\n> `use the templates and CSS in this repo to create a new artifact with all HTML and CSS inline that shows me my homepage with some of those inline content types mixed in`\n\nAfter some iteration we got to this artifact mockup, which was enough to convince me that the concept had legs and was worth handing over to full Claude Code for web to implement.\n\nIf you want to see how the rest of the build played out the most interesting PRs are Beats #592 which implemented the core feature and Add Museums Beat importer #595 which added the Museums content type.\n\nPosted 20th February 2026 at 11:47 pm · Follow me on Mastodon, Bluesky, Twitter or subscribe to my newsletter\n\n## More recent articles\n\n* Two new Showboat tools: Chartroom and datasette-showboat - 17th February 2026\n* Deep Blue - 15th February 2026\n\nThis is **Adding TILs, releases, museums, tools and research to my blog** by Simon Willison, posted on 20th February 2026.\n\nPart of series **How I blog**\n\n9.

    "content": "I was today years old when I realized that:\n\n* Code and code comments ideally should be wrapped to a different\n  column.\n* For comments, the width should be relative to the start of the\n  comment.\n\nIt’s a good idea to limit line length to about 100 columns. This is a\nphysical limit, the width at which you can still comfortably fit two\neditors side by side (see\n*Size Matters*). Note an apparent contradiction: the optimal\nwidth for readable prose is usually taken to be narrower, 60–70\ncolumns. The contradiction is resolved by noticing that, for code,\nindentation eats into usable space. Typically, code is much less\ntypographically dense than prose.\n\nStill, I find comment blocks easier to read when they are wrapped\nnarrower than the surrounding code. I want lines to be wrapped at 100,\nand *content* of comments to be wrapped at 70 (unless that\npushes overall line to be longer than 100). That is, I want layout\nlike this (using 20/30 rulers instead of 70/100, for illustrative\npurposes):\n\n```\n// Top level comments\n// can be this wide.\nconst S = struct {\n    // Nested comments are\n    // also this wide, but\n    // are shifted right.\n    fn f() void {\n        switch (value) {\n            0 => {\n                // But there is\n                // a hard limit.\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis feels obvious in retrospect, but notably isn’t be well-supported\nby the tools? The\nVS Code extension I use allows configuring dedicated fill column\nfor comments, but doesn’t make it *relative*, so indented\ncomment blocks are always narrower than top-level ones. Emacs `M-q` also doesn’t do relative wrapping out of the box!\n\n---\n\nAside on hard-wrapping: should we bother with wrapping comments at\nall? Can’t we rely on our editor to implement soft-wrapping? The\nproblem with soft-wrapping is that you can’t soft-wrap text correctly\nwithout understanding its meaning. Consider a markdown list:\n\n```\nA list:\n  * item one,\n  * item two.\n```\n\nIf the first item is long enough to necessitate wrapping, the wrapped\nline should also be indented, which requires parsing the text as\nmarkdown first:\n\n```\nA list:\n  * item one which is long enough\n    necessitate wrapping,\n  * item two.\n```",

    "content": "When a whale dies in the open ocean, its carcass sinks to the abyssal floor and becomes an ecosystem. Marine biologists call this a whale fall, and the body sustains life in three overlapping stages: mobile scavengers strip the soft tissue over months, enrichment opportunists colonise the bones and surrounding sediment for years, and chemosynthetic bacteria feed on the skeleton itself for decades, converting the lipids stored in bone into energy that supports entire communities of specialised organisms. A single whale fall can sustain life on an otherwise barren ocean floor for fifty years.\n\nMichael Winser mentioned whale fall offhand while we were talking about what happens to the dependency graphs of abandoned projects, and it won’t leave my head.\n\nA large open source project goes unmaintained. Maybe the maintainer burns out, maybe the company behind it pivots. The project stops getting updates but doesn’t disappear. It sits on GitHub accumulating issues, its last commit receding further into the past, and somebody forks it to start merging the most urgent patches. If the project was popular enough, multiple forks appear, competing for users the way hagfish compete for blubber, though most die quickly and one or two survive on the strength of someone with enough time or institutional support to keep going. OpenOffice became LibreOffice this way, MySQL became MariaDB, Hudson became Jenkins, each a scavenger fork that grew into the canonical replacement through a familiar sequence of fork announcement, migration guide, and “why you should switch” blog posts.\n\nSmaller projects then start extracting specific modules or building tools that target the dead project’s data formats. Google Reader wasn’t open source, but the same thing happened when it shut down: Feedly, Miniflux, FreshRSS, Tiny Tiny RSS, and a dozen others rushed to fill the vacuum, several of them implementing the Google Reader API or the Fever API not because those were good APIs but because years of RSS clients had been built to speak them. The licence didn’t matter. The interfaces were public, other software depended on them, and that was enough.\n\nAnd then the structural skeleton, the protocols and file formats and API contracts, goes on supporting specialised communities that may not even know where the bones came from. OpenDocument Format has outlasted the OpenOffice community that created it, sustained by document format libraries across dozens of language ecosystems. Docker donated its container runtime and image format to the Open Container Initiative in 2015. The OCI spec now defines how containers work regardless of runtime. Docker’s own dominance faded; the spec didn’t. Tree-sitter was built for Atom, and after GitHub archived Atom it became the syntax engine inside Zed, Neovim, Helix, and most editors shipped in the last few years.\n\n### Succession\n\nThe pattern I keep noticing with unmaintained libraries is successive recolonisation. A project goes quiet, someone forks it, other projects start depending on the fork, and then that fork maintainer burns out too and the whole cycle repeats at a smaller scale. Each generation of fork is typically smaller than the last, with fewer contributors and a narrower user base, until eventually the idea itself migrates rather than the code. Someone in another language ecosystem looks at the accumulated wreckage and decides to rewrite the concept from scratch, carrying the design forward but leaving the implementation behind.\n\nSass went through this. The original reference implementation was a Ruby gem. When Ruby’s performance became a bottleneck, LibSass rewrote it in C++, and the `sassc` gem wrapped that for Ruby users. Then LibSass itself was deprecated in favour of Dart Sass, which is now the canonical implementation. The concept migrated from Ruby to C++ to Dart across a decade, each rewrite benefiting from the accumulated bug reports and design arguments of its predecessors, and at each stage there were wrapper libraries in other ecosystems feeding on the structural skeleton of the Sass language spec. Most people writing Sass today have no idea it started as a Ruby gem.\n\nSuccessive recolonisation has a nasty failure mode. Edera discovered a differential parsing bug in Rust’s tar-rs library that affected every fork downstream: tar-rs itself, async-tar, tokio-tar, and multiple internal forks maintained by companies like Astral (whose fork ships inside the uv package manager). Coordinated disclosure meant contacting around twenty entities across a fragmented fork graph where three of the four library versions were unmaintained and several maintainers were unreachable. The vulnerability existed because the code had been copied forward through successive forks without anyone re-auditing the PAX header parsing that all of them inherited from the original. The bug had been sitting in the bones the whole time, inherited by every fork. Discovering which forks of a package are affected by an advisory is a problem I’m working on separately, because right now nobody has good tooling for it.\n\nCentOS after the Stream pivot is the same pattern at operating system scale: Rocky Linux and AlmaLinux forked, smaller RHEL-compatible rebuilds appeared in the enrichment layer around them, and the structural skeleton underneath, RPM packaging, systemd conventions, filesystem hierarchy, persisted unchanged regardless of which particular distribution is alive or dead at any given moment.\n\n### Licence changes\n\nWhen a project switches from an open source licence to a source-available one, the scavenger stage triggers almost immediately, often before the change even takes effect. Redis to Valkey, Elasticsearch to OpenSearch, Terraform to OpenTofu, the pattern by now is familiar enough that the community has it down to a routine: rush to fork the last open commit, compete briefly, and consolidate around one or two survivors. The organism isn’t exactly dead in these cases. Redis the product still has revenue and a roadmap. But from the perspective of the open source ecosystem the body of code has stopped accepting outside contributions, and the forks start drifting from the original the way MariaDB drifted from MySQL.\n\nThe abstraction layers are the part that lasts. Every project that integrated with the open version faces a choice between following the proprietary version or switching to the fork, and plenty of them just build a compatibility shim instead. Those shims tend to outlast the controversy that created them, feeding quietly on the skeleton of the original API years after the licence debate has cooled off.\n\n### Sun Microsystems\n\nOracle’s acquisition of Sun in 2010 was less a single whale fall than an entire pod dying at sea simultaneously. Java, Solaris, ZFS, DTrace, VirtualBox, NetBeans, GlassFish, Hudson, MySQL, each sank to a separate ocean floor and spawned its own succession. Some produced single dominant forks (Hudson to Jenkins, ZFS to OpenZFS), others scattered into competing lineages (MySQL alone fed MariaDB, Percona, and briefly Drizzle, which itself became a smaller whale fall when it was abandoned), and some bounced between foundations before settling (NetBeans to Apache, GlassFish to Payara and the broader Jakarta EE ecosystem). The structural skeletons underneath all of it, the JVM bytecode format, the ZFS on-disk format, the MySQL wire protocol, are still load-bearing in projects whose developers have never heard of Sun.\n\n### Shallow water\n\nSome projects die in shallow water where the carcass gets recycled quickly. Acqui-hires work this way: the company gets absorbed, the code goes proprietary or gets archived, and the knowledge disperses with the people rather than accumulating in a public carcass that others can feed on. Corporate consolidation has a similar effect, because when a large independent project gets folded into a platform company’s proprietary service, the nutrients get recycled in the water column rather than sinking deep enough for succession to happen.\n\nI think the current trend of consolidation under cloud providers is reducing the whale fall rate in open source, and that this has second-order effects on ecosystem diversity that nobody is tracking. You could measure it: look at the fork and dependency graphs of dead projects over time, count how many new projects cite a dead dependency, compare the half-life of a whale fall in npm versus crates versus rubygems. Do some ecosystems have deeper ocean floors, slower decomposition, longer-lasting structural influence? The data exists in package registries and forge APIs, but I haven’t seen anyone ask the question.\n\nAn open source ecosystem where every large project is owned by a platform company, maintained indefinitely or quietly absorbed on death, is one where those enrichment and chemosynthetic stages rarely get a chance to develop, and the small specialised organisms that depend on whale falls for food never get a chance to evolve. The healthiest ecosystems have a steady supply of whale falls, which is an odd thing to root for since it means wishing for the death of large projects, except that the deep ocean floor has no other food source.",

    "content": "I’ve written before about computing big Fibonacci numbers, and about creating a certificate to verify a Fibonacci number has been calculated correctly. This post will revisit both, giving a different approach to computing big Fibonacci numbers that produces a certificate along the way.\n\nAs I’ve said before, I’m not aware of any practical reason to compute large Fibonacci numbers. However, the process illustrates techniques that are practical for other problems.\n\nThe fastest way to compute the *n*th Fibonacci number for sufficiently large *n* is Binet’s formula:\n\n*F**n* = round( φ*n* / √5 )\n\nwhere φ is the golden ratio. The point where *n* is “sufficiently large” depends on your hardware and software, but in my experience I found the crossover to be somewhere 1,000 and 10,000.\n\nThe problem with Binet’s formula is that it requires extended precision floating point math. You need extra guard digits to make sure the integer part of your result is entirely correct. How many guard digits you’ll need isn’t obvious *a priori*. This post gave a way of *detecting* errors, and it could be turned into a method for *correcting* errors.\n\nBut how do we know an error didn’t slip by undetected? This question brings us back to the idea of certifying a Fibonacci number. A number *f* Fibonacci number if and only if one of 5*f*2 ± 4 is a perfect square.\n\nBinet’s formula, implemented in finite precision, takes a positive integer *n* and gives us a number *f* that is approximately the *n*th Fibonacci number. Even in low-precision arithmetic, the *relative* error in the computation is small. And because the ratio of consecutive Fibonacci numbers is approximately φ, an approximation to *F**n* is far from the Fibonacci numbers *F**n* − 1 and *F**n* + 1. So the closest Fibonacci number to an approximation of *F**n* is exactly *F**n* unless the error in the approximation is more than 50%.\n\nNow if *f* is approximately *F**n*, then 5*f*2 is approximately a square. Find the integer *r* minimizing  |5*f*2 − *r*²|. In Python you could do this with the `isqrt` function. Then either *r*² + 4 or *r*² − 4 is divisible by 5. You can know which one by looking at *r*² mod 5. Whichever one is is, divide it by 5 and you have the square of *F**n*. You can take the square root exactly, in integer arithmetic, and you have *F**n*. Furthermore, the number *r* that you computed along the way is the certificate of the calculation of *F**n*.\n\nWith the algorithm described above, we don’t need the initial approximation of *F**n* to be very accurate. We could use ordinary floating point arithmetic, as long as our numbers don’t overflow. If we need extended floating point, it would not be for accuracy but to avoid overflow. It in terms of floating point representation, you need lots of exponent bits but not many significand bits.",

Prices in the midwest and parts of the northeast are up, prices in the south are down. [X]\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3UQo!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0db26002-6065-4c8b-b93b-c4bbf7dd6a89_1236x1142.png)\n\nInterestingly, this map lines up really well with this map of what time period the largest fraction of homes in a given area were built in. In the midwest and northeast, for most areas the largest fraction were built prior to 1939. In the south, for most areas it’s post-2000.

One interesting datapoint: for low-income brackets, renters have a higher propensity to invest in crypto, and a higher rate of reporting that they put in low effort at work. [Bloomberg]\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OToJ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8b2c4ea-a0c5-48fb-8afb-1e6ec6a89f5a_640x725.png)\n\nRelated, in an essay about California’s pivot to anti-growth in the 1960s, I noted how Prop 13, which cut property taxes and locked in extremely low tax rates, cemented the opposition to growth that had been rising since the 1960s, and that there were similar “tax revolts” in states across the country. Now it seems like opposition to property tax is gaining traction again: Florida’s house of representatives just passed a bill that would remove non-school property taxes for all “homesteaded properties” (which, as I understand it, basically means primary residences). [Florida Phoenix]\n\n#### **Manufacturing**\n\nThe Rhodium Group has a good article breaking down why Chinese EVs are so cheap. It doesn’t seem to be about labor productivity (which is lower than Western firms), or subsidies. Instead, the advantage mostly comes from the level of vertical integration they’re operating at. “For BYD, vertical integration is the single most important factor behind the company’s price advantage. That said, even among Chinese OEMs, BYD and Leapmotor are outliers. This helps explain why BYD has been among the companies most consistently leading price decreases over 2024 and 2025. Vertical integration requires higher upfront capex and R&D, but it eliminates supplier markups across a much larger share of the vehicle.” [RHG]\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0spy!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39af9cde-03fe-412c-8860-f3037444bf8d_1056x659.png)\n\nDiscussions between Ford and the Trump administration about setting up Chinese car plants in the US via joint ventures. This idea keeps coming up. [Bloomberg]\n\nThanks to the trade war with China, and the huge amount of chips and other electronics the US is importing from Taiwan for data center construction, the US now imports more from Taiwan than it does from China.

Near Syracuse, Micron just broke ground on a $100 billion fab complex that represents the state of New York’s largest-ever private investment.” [Wall Street Journal]\n\nLikewise, TSMC is planning to spend $100B on four more Arizona fabs. [Tech Powerup]\n\nThe WSJ on the EV writedowns of the US auto manufacturers. “More than $20 billion in previously announced investments in EV and battery facilities were wiped out last year, according to Atlas Public Policy, which tracks clean-economy investments. That drove the first net annual decrease in announced investments in years.” [Wall Street Journal] Related, car manufacturer Stellantis sells its stake in a Canadian battery manufacturing plant for $100.

And it seems like things might get even worse for them. “A major concern for the big companies is whether the Trump administration will do away with the special liability protections afforded to vaccine makers that have helped them stay in the market.” [NYT]\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!G77S!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb0513a57-d0c9-4376-9004-442b194b4646_634x439.png)\n\n## This post is for paid subscribers\n\nSubscribe\n\nAlready a paid subscriber? **Sign in**\n\nPrevious",
