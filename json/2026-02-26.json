What would you do if your passengers were killed - not by a terrifying alien, but by Count Dracula???\n\nWhat if, on the return journey, another set of your passengers were similarly slaughtered. Except, this time, by a Werewolf? How would that make you feel? Would it drive you mad? Could you cope with the bullying from other starships? Or would you feel the need… the need for REVENGE!\n\nAs I said, silly and campy fun. It is episodic adventure with just the right amount of Hammer-style horror and not too much technobabble. All the classic monsters are here - depression, intrusive thoughts, envy, fear.\n\nOh, and Frankenstein’s spider.\n\nAs an ebook, it makes great use of fonts - which give it a delightfully retrofuturistic feel. There are some fun binary Easter-Eggs as well.\n\n| Verdict |\n| --- |\n| ★★★⯪☆ Good |\n\n### Get the book\n\nSupport my blog by using these affiliate links:\n\n*

    "content": "Last time, we looked at  recognizing that the user clicked the Close button (or equivalent nonclient gestures) on a dialog. The other system-provided pathway to dismissing a dialog is pressing `ESC`, and we saw in our flow diagram that this is done by the `Is­Dialog­Message` function.\n\nIf your dialog box doesn’t have an `IDCANCEL` button, then you can detect that the user hit `ESC` by simply recognizing that they didn’t click the Close button. If you shut off the `WM_CLOSE` pathway, then the only other source of `IDCANCEL` is the `ESC` key.\n\nNow, you might be concerned that additional pathways for system-provided dialog dismissal may be added later. (Who knows, maybe a new touch gesture will be invented.) But you can’t predict what pathway that future system-provide dismissal will take, so you have nothing to code to. All you can do is cover the pathways that you know and hope that any future dismissal mechanisms will follow one of them.\n\nWe saw from our diagram that the `ESC` pathway consists of the `Is­Dialog­Message` function processing a `WM_KEY­DOWN` for the `ESC` key and turning it into a `WM_COMMAND` button click for `IDCANCEL`. By the time it is converted into a fake button click message, it’s too late to know what the source was, so we’ll have to do the work before then.\n\nOne way to do this is to recognize the `ESC` key *before* calling `IsDialogMessage`. If your dialog was created as a modeless dialog, then you already have a custom dialog message loop. And if it was created as a modal dialog, you can  convert it to a modeless one with a dialog message loop. Once that’s done, you can  treat the `ESC` key as if it were custom navigation.\n\nYour first try might go like this:\n\n```\nwhile (⟦ dialog still active ⟧ &&\r\n       GetMessage(&msg, NULL, 0, 0, 0)) {\r\n if (msg.message == WM_KEYDOWN &&\r\n     msg.wParam == VK_ESCAPE) {\r\n  ⟦ do custom ESC key handling ⟧\r\n } else if (!IsDialogMessage(hdlg, &msg)) {\r\n  TranslateMessage(&msg);\r\n  DispatchMessage(&msg);\r\n }\r\n}\r\n```\n\nHowever, this fails to honor controls that declare `DLGC_WANT­ALL­KEYS` or `DLGC_WANT­MESSAGE`. We’ll have to check with the focus control to see if it wants to use the `ESC` key for its own purposes. While we’re at it, we’ll also ensure that we are stealing `ESC` keys only from our own dialog. The code is getting complex enough that we’ll break it out into a helper function.\n\n```\nbool IsDialogESC(HDLG hdlg, MSG const* msg)\r\n{\r\n    if (msg->message != WM_KEYDOWN ||\r\n        msg->wParam != VK_ESCAPE) {\r\n        return false;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    if (msg->hwnd != hdlg &&\r\n        !IsChild(hdlg, msg->hwnd)) {\r\n        return false;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    auto code = SendMessage(msg->hwnd, WM_GETDLGCODE,\r\n                            msg->wParam, (LPARAM)msg);\r\n    if (code & (DLGC_WANTALLKEYS | DLGC_WANTMESSAGE)) {\r\n        return false;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return true;\r\n}\r\n```\n\nIn order for this to be a potential dialog-dismissing `ESC`, the message must be a `WM_KEY­DOWN` of `VK_ESCAPE`, and the message must target the dialog or a child of the dialog. And the target window also must decline to handle the message itself.\n\nI carefully ordered the tests so that we can early-out as quickly as possible. Checking for the `ESC` key can be done by inspecting the message. Checking that the target window is acceptable is a little more work, but not too bad. Checking whether the target window wants to handle the message is the most expensive test, so we do that last.\n\nNow we can incorporate this helper function into our custom message loop.\n\n```\nwhile (⟦ dialog still active ⟧ &&\r\n       GetMessage(&msg, NULL, 0, 0, 0)) {\r\n if (IsDialogESC(hdlg, &msg)) {\r\n  ⟦ do custom ESC key handling ⟧\r\n } else if (!IsDialogMessage(hdlg, &msg)) {\r\n  TranslateMessage(&msg);\r\n  DispatchMessage(&msg);\r\n }\r\n}\r\n```\n\nThis all sounds great, but you might not be able to make this change. For example, maybe the dialog box’s dialog procedure uses `End­Dialog()` to dismiss the dialog. The fact that it has been called is not exposed by the dialog box infrastructure. Or maybe you don’t control the code that calls `Dialog­Box` in the first place, so you can’t make them switch to a modeless dialog box with a custom dialog loop.\n\nWe’ll study this problem next time.",

His hair has been replaced with a Trump wig and his skin has been tinted Cheeto orange. The background is the Great Seal of the USA, and the arrows in the eagle's claw have been replaced with a bundle of glowing fiber optics.](https://i0.wp.com/craphound.com/images/trump-data-sovereignty.jpg?w=840&ssl=1)\n\n# If you build it (and it works), Trump will come (and take it) (permalink)\n\nCrises precipitate change: Trump's incontinent belligerence spurred the world to long-overdue action on \"digital sovereignty,\" as people woke up to the stark realization that a handful of Trump-aligned giant tech firms could shut down their governments, companies and households at the click of a mouse.\n\nThis has been a long, long time coming. Long before Trump, the Snowden revelations made it clear that the US government had weaponized its position as the world's IT export powerhouse *and* the interchange hub for the world's transoceanic fiber links, and was actively spying on everyone – allies and foes, presidents and plebs – to attain geopolitical and commercial advantages for America. Even after that stark reminder, the world continued to putter along, knowing that the US had planted demolition charges in its digital infrastructure, but praying that the \"rules-based international order\" would stop America from pushing the button.\n\nNow, more than a decade into the Trump era, the world is *finally* confronting the reality that they need to get the hell off of American IT, and transition to open, transparent and verifiable alternatives for their administrative tools, telecoms infrastructure and embedded systems for agriculture, industry and transportation. And not a moment too soon:\n\nhttps://pluralistic.net/2026/01/01/39c3/#the-new-coalition\n\nBut building the post-American internet is easier said than done. There remain huge, unresolved questions about the best way to proceed.\n\nOne thing is clear: we will need new systems: the aforementioned open, transparent, verifiable code and hardware. That's a huge project, but the good news is that it benefits tremendously from scale, which means that as countries, businesses and households switch to the post-American internet, there will be ever more resources to devote to building, maintaining and improving this project. That's how scientific endeavors work: they're global collaborations that allow multiple parties to simultaneously attack the problems from many angles at once. Think of the global effort to sequence, understand, and produce vaccines for Covid 19.\n\nDeveloping the code and hardware for the post-American internet scales beautifully, making it unique among the many tasks posed by the post-American world. Other untrustworthy US platforms – such as the dollar, or the fiber links that make interconnection in the USA – are *hampered* by scale. The fact that hundreds of countries use the dollar and rely on US fiber connections makes replacing them harder, not easier:\n\nhttps://pluralistic.net/2025/11/26/difficult-multipolarism/#eurostack\n\nBuilding the post-American internet isn't easy, but there's a clear set of construction plans. What's far less clear is how we *transition* to the post-American internet. How do people, organizations and governments that currently have their data locked up in US Big Tech silos get it off their platforms and onto new, open, transparent, verifiable successors? Literally: how do you move the data from the old system to the new one, preserving things like edit/view permissions, edit histories, and other complex data-structures that often have high-stakes attached to them (for example, many organizations and governments are legally required to maintain strict view/edit permissions for sensitive data, and must preserve the histories of their documents).\n\nOn top of that, there's all the *systems* that we use to talk to one another: media services from Instagram to Tiktok to Youtube; chat services from iMessage to Discord. It's easy enough to build alternatives to these services – indeed, they already exist, though they may require additional engineering to scale them up for hundreds of millions or billions of users – but that's only half the battle. What do we do about the literal billions of people who are already using the American systems?\n\nThis is where the big divisions appear. In one camp, you have the \"if you build it, they will come\" school, who say that all we need to do is make our services so obviously superior to the legacy services that America has exported around the world and people will just switch. This is a very seductive argument. After all, the American systems are visibly, painfully defective: riddled with surveillance and ads, powered by terrible algorithms, plagued by moderation failures.\n\nBut waiting for people to recognize the superiority of your alternatives and jumping ship is a dead end. It completely misapprehends the reason that users are *still* on legacy social media and other platforms. People don't use Instagram because they love Mark Zuckerberg; they use it because they love their friends more than they hate Mark Zuckerberg:\n\nhttps://pluralistic.net/2026/01/30/zucksauce/#gandersauce\n\nWhat's more, Zuckerberg knows this. He knows that users of his service are hamstrung by the \"collective action problem\" of getting the people who matter to you to agree on when it's time to leave a service, and on which service is a safe haven to flee to:\n\nhttps://pluralistic.net/2022/10/29/how-to-leave-dying-social-media-platforms/\n\nThe reason Zuckerberg knows this is that he had to contend with it at the dawn of Facebook, when the majority of social media users were locked into an obviously inferior legacy platform called Myspace. Zuckerberg promised Myspace users a superior social media experience where they wouldn't be spied on or bombarded with ads:\n\nhttps://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\\_id=3247362\n\nZuckerberg knew that wouldn't be enough. No one was going to leave Myspace for Facebook and hang out in splendid isolation, smugly re-reading Facebook's world-beating privacy policy while waiting for their dopey friends to wise up and leave Myspace to come and join them.\n\nNo: Zuckerberg gave the Myspace refugees a bot, which would accept your Myspace login and password and then impersonate you to Myspace's servers several times per day, scraping all the content waiting for you in your Myspace feed and flowing it into your Facebook feed. You could reply to it there and the bot would push it out to Myspace. You could eat your cake and have it too: use Facebook, but communicate with the people who were still on Myspace.\n\nThis is called \"adversarial interoperability\" and it was once the norm, but the companies that rose to power by \"moving fast and breaking things\" went on to secure legal protections to prevent anyone from doing unto them as they had done unto their own predecessors:\n\nhttps://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/10/adversarial-interoperability\n\nThe harder it is for people to leave a platform, the worse the platform can treat them without paying the penalty of losing users. This is the source of enshittification: when a company can move value from its users and customers to itself without risking their departure, it *does*.\n\nPeople stay on bad platforms because the value they provide to one another is greater than the costs the platform extracts from them. That means that when you see people stuck on a *very* bad platform – like Twitter, Instagram or Facebook – you should infer that what they get there from the people that matter to them is *really* important to them. They stick to platforms because that's where they meet with people who share their rare disease, because that's where they find the customers or audiences that they rely on to make rent; because that's the only place they can find the people they left behind when they emigrated.\n\nNow, it's entirely possible – likely, even – that legacy social media platforms will grow *so* terrible that people will leave and jettison those social connections that mean so much to them. *This is not a good outcome*. Those communities, once shattered, will likely never re-form. There will be *permanent*, *irretrievable* losses incurred by their members:\n\nhttps://pluralistic.net/2023/07/23/when-the-town-square-shatters/\n\nThe platforms are sinking ships. We need to evacuate them:\n\nhttps://pluralistic.net/2024/03/23/evacuate-the-platforms/#let-the-platforms-burn\n\n\"If you build it, they will come\" is a trap. Technologists and their users who don't understand the pernicious nature of the collective active problem trap *themselves*. They build obviously superior technical platforms and then gnash their teeth as the rest of the world fails to make the leap.\n\nAll too often, users' frustration at the failure of new services to slay the inferior legacy services curdles, and users and designers of new technologies decide that the people who won't join them are somehow *themselves* defective. It doesn't take long to find a corner of the Fediverse or Bluesky where Facebook and Twitter *users* are being condemned as morally suspect for staying on zuckermuskian media. They are damned for loving Zuckerberg and Musk, rather than empathized with for loving each other more than they hate the oligarchs who've trapped them. They're condemned as emotionally stunted \"attention whores\" who hang out on big platforms to get \"dopamine\" (or some other pseudoscientific reward), which is easier than grappling with the fact that legacy social media pays their bills, and tolerating Zuckerberg or Musk is preferable to getting evicted.\n\nWorst of all, condemning users of legacy technology as moral failures leads you to oppose efforts to get those users out of harm's way and onto modern platforms. Think of the outcry at Meta's Threads taking steps to federate with Mastodon. There are good reasons to worry about this – the best one being that it might allow Meta to (illegally) suck up Mastodon users' data and store and process it. But the majority of the opposition to Threads integration with Mastodon wasn't about Threads' *management* – it was about Threads' *users*. It posited a certain kind of moral defective who would use a Zuckerberg-controlled platform in the 2020s and insisted that those people would ruin Mastodon by bringing over their illegitimate social practices.\n\nI've made no secret of where I come down in this debate: the *owners* of legacy social media are my enemy, but the *users* of those platforms are my comrades, and I want to help them get shut of legacy social media as quickly and painlessly as possible.\n\nWhat's more, there's a way to make this happen! The same adversarial interoperability that served Zuckerberg so well when he was draining users off of Myspace could be used today to evacuate all of Meta's platforms. We could use a combination of on-device bridging, scraping and other guerrilla tactics to create \"alt clients\" that let you interact with people on Mastodon *and* the legacy platforms in one context, so that you can leave the bad services but keep the good people in your life.\n\nThe major barrier to this isn't technological. Despite the boasts of these companies to world-beating engineering prowess, the reality that people (often teenagers) keep successfully finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in the \"impregnable\" platforms, in order to build successful alt clients:\n\nhttps://pluralistic.net/2023/12/07/blue-bubbles-for-all/#never-underestimate-the-determination-of-a-kid-who-is-time-rich-and-cash-poor\n\nThe thing that eventually sees off these alt clients isn't Big Tech's technical countermeasures – it's legal risk. A global system of \"anticircumvention\" laws makes the kinds of basic reverse-engineering associated with building and maintaining using adversarial interoperability *radioactively* illegal. These laws didn't appear out of thin air, either: the US Trade Representative pressured all of America's trading partners into passing them:\n\nhttps://pluralistic.net/2024/11/15/radical-extremists/#sex-pest\n\nWhich brings me back to crises precipitating change. Trump has staged an unscheduled, sudden, midair disassembly of the global system of trade, whacking tariffs on every country in the world, even in defiance of the Supreme Court:\n\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cd6zn3ly22yo\n\nIronically, this has only helped make the case for adversarial interoperability. Trump is using tech companies to attack his geopolitical rivals, ordering Microsoft to shut down both the International Criminal Court and a Brazilian high court in retaliation for their pursuit of the criminal dictators Benjamin Netanyahu and Jair Bolsonaro. This means that Trump has violated the *quid pro quo* deal for keeping anticircumvention law on your statute books, and he has made the case for killing anticircumvention as quickly as possible in order to escape American tech platforms before they are weaponized against you:\n\nhttps://pluralistic.net/2026/01/29/post-american-canada/#ottawa\n\nI've been talking about this for more than a year now, and I must say, the reception has been better than I dared dream. I think that – for the first time in my adult life – we are on the verge of creating a new, good, billionaire-proof internet:\n\nhttps://pluralistic.net/2026/01/15/how-the-light-gets-in/\n\nBut there's one objection that keeps coming up: \"What if this makes Trump mad?\" Or, more specifically, \"What if this makes Trump *more* mad, so instead of hitting us with a 10% tariff, it's a 1,000% tariff?\n\nThis came up earlier this week, when I gave a remote keynote for the Fedimtl conference, and an audience member said that he thought we should just focus on building good new platforms, rather than risking Trump's ire. In my response, I recited the arguments I've raised in this piece.\n\nBut yesterday, I saw a news item that made me realize there was one more argument I should have made, but missed. It was a Reuters story about Trump ordering American diplomats to fight against \"data sovereignty\" policies around the world:\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/us-orders-diplomats-fight-data-sovereignty-initiatives-2026-02-25/\n\nThe news comes from a leaked diplomatic cable, and it's a reminder that T...",

    "content": "# Simon Willison’s Weblog\n\nSubscribe\n\n25th February 2026 - Link Blog\n\n**Claude Code Remote Control** (via) New Claude Code feature dropped yesterday: you can now run a \"remote control\" session on your computer and then use the Claude Code for web interfaces (on web, iOS and native desktop app) to send prompts to that session.\n\nIt's a little bit janky right now. Initially when I tried it I got the error \"Remote Control is not enabled for your account. Contact your administrator.\" (but I *am* my administrator?) - then I logged out and back into the Claude Code terminal app and it started working:\n\n```\nclaude remote-control\n```\n\nYou can only run one session on your machine at a time. If you upgrade the Claude iOS app it then shows up as \"Remote Control Session (Mac)\" in the Code tab.\n\nIt appears not to support the `--dangerously-skip-permissions` flag (I passed that to `claude remote-control` and it didn't reject the option, but it also appeared to have no effect) - which means you have to approve every new action it takes.\n\nI also managed to get it to a state where every prompt I tried was met by an API 500 error.\n\n![Screenshot of a \"Remote Control session\" (Mac:dev:817b) chat interface. User message: \"Play vampire by Olivia Rodrigo in music app\". Response shows an API Error: 500 {\"type\":\"error\",\"error\":{\"type\":\"api_error\",\"message\":\"Internal server error\"},\"request_id\":\"req_011CYVBLH9yt2ze2qehrX8nk\"} with a \"Try again\" button. Below, the assistant responds: \"I'll play \"Vampire\" by Olivia Rodrigo in the Music app using AppleScript.\" A Bash command panel is open showing an osascript command: osascript -e 'tell application \"Music\" activate set searchResults to search playlist \"Library\" for \"vampire Olivia Rodrigo\" if (count of searchResults) > 0 then play item 1 of searchResults else return \"Song not found in library\" end if end tell'](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/vampire-remote.jpg)\n\nRestarting the program on the machine also causes existing sessions to start returning mysterious API errors rather than neatly explaining that the session has terminated.\n\nI expect they'll iron out all of these issues relatively quickly. It's interesting to then contrast this to solutions like OpenClaw, where one of the big selling points is the ability to control your personal device from your phone.\n\nClaude Code still doesn't have a documented mechanism for running things on a schedule, which is the other killer feature of the Claw category of software.\n\n**Update**: I spoke too soon: also today Anthropic announced Schedule recurring tasks in Cowork, Claude Code's general agent sibling. These do include an important limitation:\n\n> Scheduled tasks only run while your computer is awake and the Claude Desktop app is open. If your computer is asleep or the app is closed when a task is scheduled to run, Cowork will skip the task, then run it automatically once your computer wakes up or you open the desktop app again.\n\nI really hope they're working on a Cowork Cloud product.\n\nPosted 25th February 2026 at 5:33 pm\n\n## Recent articles\n\n* I vibe coded my dream macOS presentation app - 25th February 2026\n* Writing about Agentic Engineering Patterns - 23rd February 2026\n* Adding TILs, releases, museums, tools and research to my blog - 20th February 2026\n\nThis is a **link post** by Simon Willison, posted on 25th February 2026.\n\nai\n1876\n\ngenerative-ai\n1662\n\napplescript\n8\n\nllms\n1627\n\nanthropic\n238\n\nclaude\n232\n\ncoding-agents\n162\n\nclaude-code\n96\n\nopenclaw\n9\n\n### Monthly briefing\n\nSponsor me for **$10/month** and get a curated email digest of the month's most important LLM developments.\n\nPay me to send you less!\n\nSponsor & subscribe\n\n* Disclosures\n* Colophon\n* ©\n* 2002\n* 2003\n* 2004\n* 2005\n* 2006\n* 2007\n* 2008\n* 2009\n* 2010\n* 2011\n* 2012\n* 2013\n* 2014\n* 2015\n* 2016\n* 2017\n* 2018\n* 2019\n* 2020\n* 2021\n* 2022\n* 2023\n* 2024\n* 2025\n* 2026",

    "content": "# Simon Willison’s Weblog\n\nSubscribe\n\n## I vibe coded my dream macOS presentation app\n\n25th February 2026\n\nI gave a talk this weekend at Social Science FOO Camp in Mountain View. The event was a classic unconference format where anyone could present a talk without needing to propose it in advance. I grabbed a slot for a talk I titled “The State of LLMs, February 2026 edition”, subtitle “It’s all changed since November!”. I vibe coded a custom macOS app for the presentation the night before.\n\n![A sticky note on a board at FOO Camp. It reads: The state of LLMs, Feb 2026 edition - it's all changed since November! Simon Willison - the card is littered with names of new models: Qwen 3.5, DeepSeek 3.2, Sonnet 4.6, Kimi K2.5, GLM5, Opus 4.5/4.6, Gemini 3.1 Pro, Codex 5.3. The card next to it says Why do Social Scientists think they need genetics? Bill January (it's not all because of AI)](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/state-of-llms.jpg)\n\nI’ve written about the last twelve months of development in LLMs in December 2023, December 2024 and December 2025. I also presented The last six months in LLMs, illustrated by pelicans on bicycles at the AI Engineer World’s Fair in June 2025. This was my first time dropping the time covered to just three months, which neatly illustrates how much the space keeps accelerating and felt appropriate given the November 2025 inflection point.\n\n(I further illustrated this acceleration by wearing a Gemini 3 sweater to the talk, which I was given a couple of weeks ago and is already out-of-date thanks to Gemini 3.1.)\n\nI always like to have at least one gimmick in any talk I give, based on the STAR moment principle I learned at Stanford—include Something They’ll Always Remember to try and help your talk stand out.\n\nFor this talk I had two gimmicks. I built the first part of the talk around coding agent assisted data analysis of Kākāpō breeding season (which meant I got to show off my mug), then did a quick tour of some new pelicans riding bicycles before ending with the reveal that the entire presentation had been presented using a new macOS app I had vibe coded in ~45 minutes the night before the talk.\n\n#### Present.app\n\nThe app is called **Present**—literally the first name I thought of. It’s built using Swift and SwiftUI and weighs in at 355KB, or 76KB compressed. Swift apps are tiny!\n\nIt may have been quick to build but the combined set of features is something I’ve wanted for *years*.\n\nI usually use Keynote for presentations, but sometimes I like to mix things up by presenting using a sequence of web pages. I do this by loading up a browser window with a tab for each page, then clicking through those tabs in turn while I talk.\n\nThis works great, but comes with a very scary disadvantage: if the browser crashes I’ve just lost my entire deck!\n\nI always have the URLs in a notes file, so I can click back to that and launch them all manually if I need to, but it’s not something I’d like to deal with in the middle of a talk.\n\nThis was my starting prompt:\n\n> Build a SwiftUI app for giving presentations where every slide is a URL. The app starts as a window with a webview on the right and a UI on the left for adding, removing and reordering the sequence of URLs. Then you click Play in a menu and the app goes full screen and the left and right keys switch between URLs\n\nThat produced a plan. You can see the transcript that implemented that plan here.\n\nIn Present a talk is an ordered sequence of URLs, with a sidebar UI for adding, removing and reordering those URLs. That’s the entirety of the editing experience.\n\n![Screenshot of a macOS app window titled \"Present\" showing Google Image search results for \"kakapo\". A web view shows a Google image search with thumbnail photos of kākāpō parrots with captions. A sidebar on the left shows a numbered list of URLs, mostly from simonwillison.net and static.simonwillison.net, with item 4 (https://www.google.com/search?...) highlighted in blue.](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/present.jpg)\n\nWhen you select the “Play” option in the menu (or hit Cmd+Shift+P) the app switches to full screen mode. Left and right arrow keys navigate back and forth, and you can bump the font size up and down or scroll the page if you need to. Hit Escape when you’re done.\n\nCrucially, Present saves your URLs automatically any time you make a change. If the app crashes you can start it back up again and restore your presentation state.\n\nYou can also save presentations as a `.txt` file (literally a newline-delimited sequence of URLs) and load them back up again later.\n\n#### Remote controlled via my phone\n\nGetting the initial app working took so little time that I decided to get more ambitious.\n\nIt’s neat having a remote control for a presentation...\n\nSo I prompted:\n\n> Add a web server which listens on 0.0.0.0:9123—the web server serves a single mobile-friendly page with prominent left and right buttons—clicking those buttons switches the slide left and right—there is also a button to start presentation mode or stop depending on the mode it is in.\n\nI have Tailscale on my laptop and my phone, which means I don’t have to worry about Wi-Fi networks blocking access between the two devices. My phone can access `http://100.122.231.116:9123/` directly from anywhere in the world and control the presentation running on my laptop.\n\nIt took a few more iterative prompts to get to the final interface, which looked like this:\n\n![Mobile phone web browser app with large buttons, Slide 4/31 at the top, Prev, Next and Start buttons, a thin bar with a up/down scroll icon and text size + and - buttons and the current slide URL at the bottom.](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/present-mobile.jpg)\n\nThere’s a slide indicator at the top, prev and next buttons, a nice big “Start” button and buttons for adjusting the font size.\n\nThe most complex feature is that thin bar next to the start button. That’s a touch-enabled scroll bar—you can slide your finger up and down on it to scroll the currently visible web page up and down on the screen.\n\nIt’s *very* clunky but it works just well enough to solve the problem of a page loading with most interesting content below the fold.\n\n#### Learning from the code\n\nI’d already pushed the code to GitHub (with a big “This app was vibe coded [...] I make no promises other than it worked on my machine!” disclaimer) when I realized I should probably take a look at the code.\n\nI used this as an opportunity to document a recent pattern I’ve been using: asking the model to present a linear walkthrough of the entire codebase. Here’s the resulting Linear walkthroughs pattern in my ongoing Agentic Engineering Patterns guide, including the prompt I used.\n\nThe resulting walkthrough document is genuinely useful. It turns out Claude Code decided to implement the web server for the remote control feature using socket programming without a library! Here’s the minimal HTTP parser it used for routing:\n\n```\n    private func route(_ raw: String) -> String {\n        let firstLine = raw.components(separatedBy: \"\\r\\n\").first ?? \"\"\n        let parts = firstLine.split(separator: \" \")\n        let path = parts.count >= 2 ? String(parts[1]) : \"/\"\n\n        switch path {\n        case \"/next\":\n            state?.goToNext()\n            return jsonResponse(\"ok\")\n        case \"/prev\":\n            state?.goToPrevious()\n            return jsonResponse(\"ok\")\n```\n\nUsing GET requests for state changes like that opens up some fun CSRF vulnerabilities. For this particular application I don’t really care.\n\n#### Expanding our horizons\n\nVibe coding stories like this are ten a penny these days. I think this one is worth sharing for a few reasons:\n\n* Swift, a language I don’t know, was absolutely the right choice here. I wanted a full screen app that embedded web content and could be controlled over the network. Swift had everything I needed.\n* When I finally did look at the code it was simple, straightforward and did exactly what I needed and not an inch more.\n* This solved a real problem for me. I’ve always wanted a good way to serve a presentation as a sequence of pages, and now I have exactly that.\n\nThis doesn’t mean native Mac developers are obsolete. I still used a whole bunch of my own accumulated technical knowledge (and the fact that I’d already installed Xcode and the like) to get this result, and someone who knew what they were doing could have built a far better solution in the same amount of time.\n\nIt’s a neat illustration of how those of us with software engineering experience can expand our horizons in fun and interesting directions. I’m no longer afraid of Swift! Next time I need a small, personal macOS app I know that it’s achievable with our existing set of tools.\n\nPosted 25th February 2026 at 4:46 pm · Follow me on Mastodon, Bluesky, Twitter or subscribe to my newsletter\n\n## More recent articles\n\n* Writing about Agentic Engineering Patterns - 23rd February 2026\n* Adding TILs, releases, museums, tools and research to my blog - 20th February 2026\n\nThis is **I vibe coded my dream macOS presentation app** by Simon Willison, posted on 25th February 2026.\n\nmacos\n105\n\nai\n1876\n\ngenerative-ai\n1662\n\nllms\n1627\n\nai-assisted-programming\n349\n\nvibe-coding\n73\n\nswift\n10\n\nagentic-engineering\n15\n\n**Previous:** Writing about Agentic Engineering Patterns\n\n### Monthly briefing\n\nSponsor me for **$10/month** and get a curated email digest of the month's most important LLM developments.\n\nPay me to send you less!\n\nSponsor & subscribe\n\n* Disclosures\n* Colophon\n* ©\n* 2002\n* 2003\n* 2004\n* 2005\n* 2006\n* 2007\n* 2008\n* 2009\n* 2010\n* 2011\n* 2012\n* 2013\n* 2014\n* 2015\n* 2016\n* 2017\n* 2018\n* 2019\n* 2020\n* 2021\n* 2022\n* 2023\n* 2024\n* 2025\n* 2026",

I don’t write this happily.\n\nBut the juxtaposition of a two things over the last few days has scared the shit out of me.\n\n**Item 1: The Trump administration seems hellbent on using AI absolutely everywhere,** and seems to be prepared to hold Anthropic (and presumably ultimately other companies) at gunpoint to allow them to use that AI however they damn please, including for mass surveillance and to guide autonomous weapons. Quoting from The New York Times yesterday:\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_oFa!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39118279-3b12-405a-9fc8-3ac9fb060c3c_1375x374.png)\n\n**Item 2: These systems cannot be trusted.** I have been trying to tell the world that since 2018, in every way I know how, but people who don’t really understand the technology keep blundering forward, ignoring the trust issues that are inherent. Already GenAI appears to have been used in the Maduro raids and to write tariff regulations. And thousands of other places.\n\nIt should be *obvious* that applying hallucinatory and unreliable Generative AI to weapon systems without humans in the loop could be catastrophic.\n\nBut in case it wasn’t, now (breaking news, hat tip Caroline Orr Bueno, PhD) we have *data*.\n\nChris Stokel-Williams just broke this story:\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!dBjX!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b6a277c-3899-4024-9b5e-f812c103c108_1445x1558.png)\n\nYou don’t really have to read the paywalled article (or the archived version, ahem) to get the idea. If you aren’t terrified, you just aren’t paying attention.\n\nHis scoop was based on a new article by Keith Payne that ran a series of models in simulated nuclear crises.\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!DDSh!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82b1d916-f906-431f-9702-c2d586f46ea0_1829x604.png)\n\nThe upshot is, quoting from the abstract, emphasis added “**the nuclear taboo is no impediment to nuclear escalation by our models**”.\n\nAs Stokel-Walker reports multiple models went for the nuclear option in 95% case. Given White House pressure to *immediately* use models that we cannot trust throughout the military, this is no longer a drill.\n\nGenerative AI is NOT remotely reliable enough to make life or death decisions of magnitude.\n\nBut unless Anthropic successfully stares down the Department of War, generative AI, as “jagged” as it is, will likely soon be used in \\*exactly\\* that way.\n\nAccording to reports, Hegseth is demanding full, unrestricted access to Anthropic’s systems by Friday afternoon by 5pm.\n\n**We are on a collision course with catastrophe.** Paraphrasing a button that I used to wear as a teenager, one hallucination could ruin your whole planet.\n\nIf we’re going to embed LLMs into the fabric of the world - and apparently we are - we MUST do so in a way that acknowledges and factors in their unreliability. Spreading it everywhere without proper consideration could well lead to disaster.\n\nThis is not a drill.\n\nSubscribe\n\n333\n\n152\n\n80\n\nShare",

    "content": "In December I wrote about package managers using git as a database, and how Cargo’s index, Homebrew’s taps, Go’s module proxy, and CocoaPods’ Specs repo all hit the same wall once their access patterns outgrew what a git repo is designed for.\n\nhomebrew-core has one Ruby file per package formula, and every `brew update` used to clone or fetch the whole repository until it got large enough that GitHub explicitly asked them to stop. Homebrew 4.0 switched to downloading a JSON file over HTTP, because users wanted the current state of a package rather than its commit history. But updating a formula still means opening a pull request against homebrew-core, because git is where the collaboration tooling lives. Instead of using git as a database, what if you used a database as a git?\n\nA git repository is a content-addressable object store where objects go in indexed by the SHA1 of their content, plus a set of named references pointing at specific objects by hash. The on-disk format (loose objects as individual files, packfiles as delta-compressed archives with a separate index, a ref store split between a directory of files and a packed-refs flat file with a locking protocol that breaks on NFS) is an implementation detail. The protocol for synchronising objects and refs between repositories is what actually matters, and since git-the-program is just one implementation of it, you can swap the storage backend without clients noticing.\n\nThe whole data model fits in two tables:\n\n```\nCREATE TABLE objects (\n    repo_id  integer NOT NULL,\n    oid      bytea NOT NULL,\n    type     smallint NOT NULL,\n    size     integer NOT NULL,\n    content  bytea NOT NULL,\n    PRIMARY KEY (repo_id, oid)\n);\n\nCREATE TABLE refs (\n    repo_id  integer NOT NULL,\n    name     text NOT NULL,\n    oid      bytea,\n    symbolic text,\n    PRIMARY KEY (repo_id, name)\n);\n```\n\nAn object’s OID is computed the same way git does it, `SHA1(\"<type> <size>\\0<content>\")`, using pgcrypto’s `digest()` function, and refs get compare-and-swap updates through `SELECT FOR UPDATE`. A libgit2 backend registers these tables as its storage layer, and if the protocol really is separable from the format, a normal git client should be able to push to and clone from a Postgres database without knowing the difference.\n\nTo test this I built gitgres, about 2,000 lines of C implementing the libgit2 `git_odb_backend` and `git_refdb_backend` interfaces against Postgres through libpq, plus roughly 200 lines of PL/pgSQL for the storage functions. libgit2 handles pack negotiation, delta resolution, ref advertisement, and the transport protocol while the backend reads and writes against the two tables, and a git remote helper (`git-remote-gitgres`) lets you add a Postgres-backed remote to any repo and push or clone with a normal git client that has no idea it’s talking to a database. There’s a Dockerfile in the repo if you want to try it out without building libgit2 and libpq from source.\n\nThe objects table contains the same bytes git would store on disk, and a set of SQL functions parse them into tree entries, commit metadata, and parent links that you can join against like any other table.\n\n```\nSELECT r.name AS repo, c.author_name, c.authored_at, i.title AS issue\nFROM commits c\nJOIN repositories r ON r.id = c.repo_id\nJOIN issues i ON i.repo_id = c.repo_id\n  AND c.message ILIKE '%#' || i.index || '%'\nWHERE c.authored_at > now() - interval '30 days';\n```\n\nThat query joins git commit data against Forgejo’s issue tracker, something that currently requires fetching commits through `git log`, pattern-matching issue references in application code, and then querying the database for the matching issues. With both sides in Postgres it’s one query.\n\n### Forgejo\n\nA self-hosted Forgejo or Gitea instance is really two systems bolted together: a web application backed by Postgres, and a collection of bare git repositories on the filesystem. Anything that needs to show git data in the web UI has to shell out to the binary and parse text, which is why something as straightforward as a blame view requires spawning a subprocess rather than running a query. If the git data lived in the same Postgres instance as everything else, that boundary disappears.\n\nForgejo stores issues, pull requests, users, permissions, webhooks, branch protection rules, and CI status in Postgres already, and git repositories are the one thing left on the filesystem, forcing every deployment to coordinate backups between them, and the two systems scale and fail in different ways. The codebase already shows the strain: Forgejo mirrors branch metadata from git into its own database tables (`models/git/branch.go`) so it can query branches without shelling out to git every time.\n\nAll git interaction goes through `modules/git`, about 15,000 lines of Go that shells out to the `git` binary and parses text output. With git data in Postgres, reading an object becomes `SELECT content FROM objects WHERE oid = $1` on the database connection Forgejo already holds, and walking commit history is a query against a materialized view rather than spawning `git log`.\n\nThe deployment collapses to a single Postgres instance where `pg_dump` backs up forge metadata, git objects, and user data together, and replicas handle read scaling for the web UI without NFS mounts or a Gitaly-style RPC layer. The path there is a Forgejo fork replacing `modules/git` with a package that queries Postgres, where `Repository` holds a database connection and repo\\_id instead of a filesystem path and `Commit`, `Tree`, `Blob` become thin wrappers around query results.\n\n### Postgres\n\nPostgres has its own primitives for things that forges currently build custom infrastructure around. A trigger on the refs table firing `NOTIFY` means any connected client learns about a push the moment it happens, which is how forges normally end up building a custom webhook polling layer. Multi-tenant repo isolation becomes a database concern through row-level security on the objects and refs tables, and logical replication lets you selectively stream repositories across Postgres instances, a kind of partial mirroring that filesystem-based git can’t do. Commit graph traversal for ancestry queries and merge-base computation falls to recursive CTEs, and `pg_trgm` indexes on blob content give you substring search across all repositories without standing up a separate search index.\n\n### Diff, merge, blame\n\nContent-level diffs, three-way merge, and blame stay in libgit2 rather than being reimplemented in SQL, since libgit2 already has that support and works against the Postgres backends through cgo bindings. The Forgejo fork would be “replace `modules/git` with libgit2 backed by Postgres” rather than “replace `modules/git` with raw SQL,” because the read-side queries only cover the simple cases and anything involving content comparison or graph algorithms still needs libgit2 doing the work with Postgres as its storage layer. That’s a meaningful dependency to carry, though libgit2 is well-maintained and already used in production by the Rust ecosystem and various GUI clients. SQL implementations of some of this using recursive CTEs would be interesting to try eventually but aren’t needed to get a working forge. The remaining missing piece is the server-side pack protocol: the remote helper covers the client side, but a Forgejo integration also needs a server that speaks `upload-pack` and `receive-pack` against Postgres, either through libgit2’s transport layer or a Go implementation that queries the objects table directly.\n\n### Storage\n\nGit packfiles use delta compression, storing only the diff when a 10MB file changes by one line, while the objects table stores each version in full. A file modified 100 times takes about 1GB in Postgres versus maybe 50MB in a packfile. Postgres does TOAST and compress large values, but that’s compressing individual objects in isolation, not delta-compressing across versions the way packfiles do, so the storage overhead is real. A delta-compression layer that periodically repacks objects within Postgres, or offloads large blobs to S3 the way LFS does, is a natural next step. For most repositories it still won’t matter since the median repo is small and disk is cheap, and GitHub’s Spokes system made a similar trade-off years ago, storing three full uncompressed copies of every repository across data centres because redundancy and operational simplicity beat storage efficiency even at hundreds of exabytes.\n\ngitgres is a neat hack right now, but if open source hosting keeps moving toward federation and decentralization, with ForgeFed, Forgejo’s federation work, and more people running small instances for their communities, the operational simplicity of a single-Postgres deployment matters more than raw storage efficiency. Getting from a handful of large forges to a lot of small ones probably depends on a forge you can stand up with `docker compose up` and back up with `pg_dump`, and that’s a lot easier when there’s no filesystem of bare repos to manage alongside the database.",

Trillions of dollars of enterprise value depended on those constraints persisting. – Citrini Research\n\nI’m glad I’m not the only one saying it. 7 years ago, I saw a Google Duplex demo where an AI called a restaurant to make a reservation for you. At first Google thought it was great, but then they realized what the implications were. No restaurant would be able to take phone reservations any more. “Make me a reservation at 10 restaurants and give me a list.” Google pulled down the video.\n\nWhat happened since is what had to happen. Third party marketplaces sprung up for reservations, and idk it’s been a while since I went to fancy dinner, but I imagine the restaurants have just started charging. Or at least the first party reservation sites do.\n\nThe best anyone can hope for is a free market, with everything properly priced. But for decades, the American market has not been free. It’s used purposefully added friction to exploit a time asymmetry between the business and you. And due to things like call centers, this has been very profitable for the businesses. Cable companies and insurance rely on the fact that your time is more valuable than theirs. They can hire people in India at scale to waste your time. They can use procedure and big data to design protocols to drive you just to the point of frustration at little cost to them. How often do you diligently check Uber and Lyft and select the cheaper one?\n\nEnter AI, the great equalizer of time.\n\n---\n\nAs it stands today, it’s looking like human level AI will actually end up with the people. This is not something we should take for granted, it’s happened due to the API being simple (tokens, on a diversified place like OpenRouter) and the priorities of the Chinese state. I feared the API would end up being complex, like the model would be deeply embedded in your phone or OS. But like people who are good with computers, the models want a terminal, not some candy ass iPad UI.\n\nWhen you analyze the AI supply chain, there’s 5 tiers. Electricity, chip manufacturing, chip design / software, models, and applications. I work on the chip design / software tier, and with a lot of hard work, I’m not too worried about a monopoly there. NVIDIA deserves return on their investment, they were very early, but there’s not a runaway flywheel here (unlike, say Google search) to continue rent seeking. And the application tier is totally commoditized. opencode is good, but it’s open source, almost all of the performance differentiation is due to the models, and if it starts to try to rent seek there will be tons of forks immediately. Godspeed to anyone who was dumb enough to invest in a GPT wrapper company.\n\nThe model tier is where I was the most worried. But here is where a great turning point is happening. Anthropic put out this lambasted blog post that looks exactly like the last gasps of a moat that shouldn’t exist. After whining about how the Chinese used their API, they ended with this call to action.\n\n> But no company can solve this alone. As we noted above, distillation attacks at this scale require a coordinated response across the AI industry, cloud providers, and policymakers. We are publishing this to make the evidence available to everyone with a stake in the outcome.\n\nNobody should “coordinate” with them. They stand alone as a vanguard of the rent seeking apparatus that is long past its expiration date. The Z.ai, Qwen, MiniMax, and Kimi models are only 6-12 months behind. And everyone in the world is rooting for the Chinese models, not closed source rent seeking from the USA. Because nobody wants the continuation of rent-seeking billionaires. The status quo is cooked. It’s time to flip the table, not rearrange the seats.\n\n---\n\n> I think the difference is not quite as nuanced. The West wants a more efficient rent seeking system. The China (sic) want AI as a public utility. – @ScottCDunn on X\n\nWe shouldn’t take for granted what we have right now. All the top tier open source models are currently being produced by China, and circumstances could change and that could stop. But I think they view the models as their complement, and you should commoditize your complement. If you are in the business of chip production and electricity generation, it’s a strategic advantage to have the layers above that be commodity.\n\nNot to mention the added bonus of the collapse of the US economy. Frankly, it’s well deserved. Nobody should build an economy based on rent seeking and increasing friction. I pray the collapse will be swift and legible so that reconstruction (in the right way) can begin as soon as possible.\n\nIt’s possible that superhuman intelligence will have some mega-compounding return and this calculus will change, but superhuman intelligence will likely just not be understandable to people, so as long as civilization is people, human intelligence is enough.\n\nThe era of purposefully frustrating humans is over. The Chinese open source model running on the box under my desk can pass the Turing Test. When you call, e-mail, text, or show me an ad, you’ll never know if it’s me or my model seeing it.",

    "content": "Dave Farquhar Retro Gaming   February 25, 2026February 25, 2026  1 Comment\n\nLegendary game designer Sid Meier was born February 24, 1954. After creating a run of popular flight simulators in the early and mid 1980s, he shifted to strategy games in the second half of the decade, creating some of the greatest strategy games of all time in the late 1980s and into the 1990s.\n\n## Early flight simulators\n\nSid Meier acquired an Atari 800 in 1981 while he was working developing software for cash registers. A coworker named Bill Stealey was also interested in video games, and the two of them founded Microprose in 1982 to market the games Meier had created. Meier coded platform games and a racing game, but his run of flight simulators, including *Hellcat Ace*, *Spitfire Ace*, *Solo Flight*, and *F-15 Strike Eagle* put Microprose on the map in the first half of the decade. Meier’s approach to simulations was to simulate the fun parts, and toss out the repetitive and less fun elements.\n\n## *Sid Meier’s Pirates!*\n\n![Sid Meier's Pirates! running on a Mac](https://i0.wp.com/dfarq.homeip.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pirates-screenshot-small.png?resize=270%2C179&ssl=1)![Sid Meier's Pirates! running on a Mac](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20270%20179%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\nPirates! received ports to several platforms including the original Mac.\n\nIn 1987, Meier took a departure from flight simulators, creating a single-player open world game called *Pirates!*, where you captain a ship, sailing across the Caribbean, plundering settlements and other ships in search of fortune and fame. Marketed as Sid Meier’s Pirates!, Microprose first released it in May 1987 for the Commodore 64, then ported it to the Amstrad CPC, Apple II, and IBM PC later that year, to the Apple IIgs and PC-88 in 1988, Atari ST in 1989, Amiga in 1990, and Nintendo NES in 1991.\n\nThe game has no predetermined end. Recruiting crew members and fighting become more difficult as the character ages, eventually forcing the character into retirement. Upon retirement, the character becomes anything from a beggar to a King’s advisor, depending on his accomplishments.\n\n## One last flight sim\n\nIn 1988, Meier worked on *F-19 Stealth Fighter*, a DOS game based on the F-117 Stealth Fighter before it was unveiled to the public. It had numerous details of the stealth fighter wrong, including the name of the plane, and was based on educated guesses about the characteristics of the still-secret fighter jet. The game ended up being released on the same day the United States admitted the existence of the F-117A Nighthawk.\n\n## *Sid Meier’s Railroad Tycoon*\n\n![Sid Meier's Railroad Tycoon](https://i0.wp.com/dfarq.homeip.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/railroad-tycoon-amiga-screenshot-orig.png?resize=300%2C188&ssl=1)\n\nRailroad Tycoon ran on DOS but also had good versions available for Amiga and ST.\n\nMeier followed it up with *Railroad Tycoon* in 1990, a turn-based strategy game where you play a railroad robber baron, laying track to connect towns, building and improving stations, and buying and scheduling trains. Along the way you can attempt to drive rival railroads out of business, invest in them, or even merge with them. Much like Pirates!, at the end of the game, the character becomes anything from a circus impresario to a newspaper editor, based on accomplishments running railroads.\n\nAlthough we remember *Railroad Tycoon* and subsequent games as DOS titles, *Railroad Tycoon* and *Civilization* did receive very capable ports to the Atari ST and Amiga.\n\n## *Sid Meier’s Civilization*\n\n![Sid Meier's Civilization screen shot](https://i0.wp.com/dfarq.homeip.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/CivilizationAmigaAGA.png?resize=300%2C188&ssl=1)![Sid Meier's Civilization screen shot](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20300%20188%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\nIn Civilization, you start out building a city and expand it into a nation.\n\n1991 brought Sid Meier’s masterpiece, *Civilization*, a turn-based strategy game where you settle a plot of land to form a city with the goal of expanding it into a long-running civilization through diplomacy, technology, and war. Along the way you have to control city development, exploration, government, trade, research, and a military. You can build and control individual units that advance the exploration, conquest and settlement of the game’s world. You also must decide on a form of government and manage tax rates and scientific research priorities. The player’s civilization is in competition with up to six other computer-controlled civilizations. You can win the game violently by conquering the world, or peacefully by colonizing Alpha Centauri. Technically, you can play an infinite game by surviving until another civilization colonizes Alpha Centauri, but what’s the fun in that?\n\nMeier followed up *Civilization* with *Colonization*, *Gettysburg*, *Alpha Centauri*, *Antietem*, and a flood of *Civilization* sequels. As the 1990s wore on, he wasn’t necessarily the main designer of every game that bore his name. Simply putting Meier’s name on a game helped ensure the game would sell.\n\nIf you found this post informative or helpful, please share it!\n\n* share\n* share\n* save\n* share\n* share\n* share\n* pocket\n* share\n* email\n* RSS feed\n\n![](https://i0.wp.com/dfarq.homeip.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/dave_farquhar_181px.jpg?resize=100%2C100&ssl=1)![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20100%20100%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\nDave Farquhar\n\nDavid Farquhar is a computer security professional, entrepreneur, and author.

Similarly, a and\nb are arbitrary scalars in ![\\mathbb{R}](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/images/math/0ed839b111fe0e3ca2b2f618b940893eaea88a57.png).\n\n**Associativity of vector addition**:\n\n\\[p(x)+[q(x)+r(x)]=p(x)+q(x)+r(x)=[p(x)+q(x)]+r(x)\\]\n\nThis is trivial because addition of polynomials is associative [1].\nCommutativity is similarly trivial, for the same reason:\n\n**Commutativity of vector addition**:\n\n\\[p(x)+q(x)=q(x)+p(x)\\]\n\n**Identity element of vector addition**:\n\nThe zero polynomial 0 serves as an identity element.\n\\forall p(x)\\in P\\_n(\\mathbb{R}), we have\n0 + p(x) = p(x).\n\n**Inverse element of vector addition**:\n\nFor each p(x), we can use q(x)=-p(x) as the additive\ninverse, because p(x)+q(x)=0.\n\n**Identity element of scalar multiplication**\n\nThe scalar 1 serves as an identity element for scalar multiplication.\nFor each p(x), it’s true that 1\\cdot p(x)=p(x).\n\n**Associativity of scalar multiplication**:\n\nFor any two scalars a and b:\n\n\\[a[b\\cdot p(x)]=ab\\cdot p(x)=[ab]\\cdot p(x)\\]\n\n**Distributivity of scalar multiplication over vector addition**:\n\nFor any p(x), q(x) and scalar a:\n\n\\[a\\cdot[p(x)+q(x)]=a\\cdot p(x)+a\\cdot q(x)\\]\n\n**Distributivity of scalar multiplication over scalar addition**:\n\nFor any scalars a and b and polynomial p(x):\n\n\\[[a+b]\\cdot p(x)=a\\cdot p(x) + b\\cdot p(x)\\]\n\n## Linear independence, span and basis\n\nSince we’ve shown that polynomials in P\\_n(\\mathbb{R}) form a\nvector space, we can now build additional linear algebraic definitions\non top of that.\n\nA set of k polynomials p\\_k(x)\\in P\\_n(\\mathbb{R}) is said\nto be *linearly independent* if\n\n\\[\\sum\\_{i=1}^{k}a\\_i p\\_i(x)=0\\]\n\nimplies a\\_i=0 \\quad \\forall i. In words, the only linear\ncombination resulting in the zero vector is when all coefficients are 0.\n\nAs an example, let’s discuss the fundamental building blocks of\npolynomials in P\\_n(\\mathbb{R}): the set\n\\{1, x, x^2, \\dots x^n\\}. These are linearly independent\nbecause:\n\n\\[a\\_0 + a\\_1 x + a\\_2 x^2 + \\cdots a\\_n x^n=0\\]\n\nis true only for zero polynomial, in which all the coefficients\na\\_i=0. This comes from the very definition of polynomials.\nMoreover, this set *spans* the entire P\\_n(\\mathbb{R}) because\nevery polynomial can be (by definition) expressed as a linear combination of\n\\{1, x, x^2, \\dots x^n\\}.\n\nSince we’ve shown these basic polynomials are linearly independent and\nspan the entire vector space, they are a *basis* for the space. In fact,\nthis set has a special name: the *monomial basis* (because a monomial is\na polynomial with a single term).\n\n## Checking if an arbitrary set of polynomials is a basis\n\nSuppose we have some set polynomials, and we want to know if these form\na basis for P\\_n(\\mathbb{R}). How do we go about it?\n\nThe idea is using linear algebra the same way we do for any other vector\nspace. Let’s use a concrete example to demonstrate:\n\n\\[Q=\\{1-x, x, 2x+x^2\\}\\]\n\nIs the set Q a basis for P\\_n(\\mathbb{R})? We’ll start by\nchecking whether the members of Q are linearly independent.\nWrite:\n\n\\[a\\_0(1-x)+a\\_1 x + a\\_2(2x+x^2)=0\\]\n\nBy regrouping, we can turn this into:\n\n\\[a\\_0 + (a\\_1-a\\_0+2a\\_2)x+a\\_2 x^2=0\\]\n\nFor this to be true, the coefficient of each monomial has to be zero;\nmathematically:\n\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\na\\_0&=0\\\\\na\\_1-a\\_0+2a\\_2&=0\\\\\na2&=0\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\\]\n\nIn matrix form:\n\n\\[\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0\\\\\n-1 & 1 & 2\\\\\n0 & 0 & 1\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}a\\_0\\\\ a\\_1\\\\ a\\_2\\end{bmatrix}\n=\\begin{bmatrix}0\\\\ 0\\\\ 0\\end{bmatrix}\\]\n\nWe know how to solve this, by reducing the matrix into row-echelon\nform. It’s easy to\nsee that the reduced row-echelon form of this specific matrix is\nI, the identity matrix. Therefore, this set of equations has a\nsingle solution: a\\_i=0 \\quad \\forall i [2].\n\nWe’ve shown that the set Q is linearly independent. Now let’s\nshow that it *spans* the space P\\_n(\\mathbb{R}). We want to\nanalyze:\n\n\\[a\\_0(1-x)+a\\_1 x + a\\_2(2x+x^2)=\\alpha +\\beta x + \\gamma x^2\\]\n\nAnd find the coefficients a\\_i that satisfy this for any\narbitrary ![\\alpha](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/images/math/f7c665b45932a814215e979bc2611080b4948e68.png), ![\\beta](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/images/math/6499d503bfc00cadae1440b191c52a8632e2f8c4.png) and \\gamma. We proceed\njust as before, by regrouping on the left side:\n\n\\[a\\_0 + (a\\_1-a\\_0+2a\\_2)x+a\\_2 x^2=\\alpha +\\beta x + \\gamma x^2\\]\n\nand equating the coefficient of each power of ![x](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/images/math/11f6ad8ec52a2984abaafd7c3b516503785c2072.png) separately:\n\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\na\\_0&=\\alpha\\\\\na\\_1-a\\_0+2a\\_2&=\\beta\\\\\na2&=\\gamma\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\\]\n\nIf we turn this into matrix form, the matrix of coefficients is exactly\nthe same as before. So we know there’s a single solution, and by\nrearranging the matrix into I, the solution will appear on the\nright hand side. It doesn’t matter for the moment what the actual\nsolution is, as long as it exists and is unique. We’ve shown that\nQ spans the space!\n\nSince the set Q is linearly independent and spans\nP\\_n(\\mathbb{R}), it is a *basis* for the space.\n\n## Inner product\n\nI’ve discussed inner products for functions in the post about Hilbert\nspace.\nWell, *polynomials are functions*, so we can define an inner product\nusing integrals as follows [3]:\n\n\\[\\langle p, q \\rangle = \\int\\_{a}^{b} p(x) q(x) w(x) \\, dx\\]\n\nWhere the bounds a and b are arbitrary, and could be\ninfinite. Whenever we deal with integrals we worry about convergence; in\nmy post on Hilbert spaces, we only talked about L^2 - the square\nintegrable functions. Most polynomials are not square integrable,\nhowever. Therefore, we can restrict this using either:\n\n1. A special *weight function* w(x) to make sure the inner\n   product integral converges\n2. Set finite bounds on the integral, and then we can just set\n   w(x)=1.\n\nLet’s use the latter, and restrict the bounds into the range\n[-1,1], setting w(x)=1. We have the following inner\nproduct:\n\n\\[\\langle p, q \\rangle = \\int\\_{-1}^{1} p(x) q(x) \\, dx\\]\n\nLet’s check that this satisfies the inner product space conditions.\n\n**Conjugate symmetry**:\n\nSince real multiplication is commutative, we can write:\n\n\\[\\langle p, q \\rangle = \\int\\_{-1}^{1} p(x) q(x) \\, dx =\\int\\_{-1}^{1} q(x) p(x) \\, dx=\\langle q, p \\rangle\\]\n\nWe deal in the reals here, so we can safely ignore complex conjugation.\n\n**Linearity in the first argument**:\n\nLet p\\_1,p\\_2,q\\in P\\_n(\\mathbb{R}) and a,b\\in \\mathbb{R}.\nWe want to show that\n\n\\[\\langle ap\\_1+bp\\_2,q \\rangle = a\\langle p\\_1,q\\rangle +b\\langle p\\_2,q\\rangle\\]\n\nExpand the left-hand side using our definition of inner product:\n\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n\\langle ap\\_1+bp\\_2,q \\rangle&=\\int\\_{-1}^{1} (a p\\_1(x)+b p\\_2(x)) q(x) \\, dx\\\\\n&=a\\int\\_{-1}^{1} p\\_1(x) q(x) \\, dx+b\\int\\_{-1}^{1} p\\_2(x) q(x) \\, dx\n\\end{aligned}\\]\n\nThe result is equivalent to\na\\langle p\\_1,q\\rangle +b\\langle p\\_2,q\\rangle.\n\n**Positive-definiteness**:\n\nWe want to show that for nonzero p\\in P\\_n(\\mathbb{R}), we have\n\\langle p, p\\rangle > 0. First of all, since p(x)^2\\geq0\nfor all ![x](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/images/math/11f6ad8ec52a2984abaafd7c3b516503785c2072.png), it’s true that:\n\n\\[\\langle p, p\\rangle=\\int\\_{-1}^{1}p(x)^2\\, dx\\geq 0\\]\n\nWhat about the result 0 though? Well, let’s say that\n\n\\[\\int\\_{-1}^{1}p(x)^2\\, dx=0\\]\n\nSince p(x)^2 is a non-negative function, this means that the\nintegral of a non-negative function ends up being 0. But p(x) is\na polynomial, so it’s *continuous*, and so is p(x)^2. If the\nintegral of a continuous non-negative function is 0, it means the\nfunction itself is 0. Had it been non-zero in any place, the integral\nwould necessarily have to be positive as well.\n\nWe’ve proven that \\langle p, p\\rangle=0 only when p is\nthe zero polynomial. The positive-definiteness condition is satisfied.\n\nIn conclusion, P\\_n(\\mathbb{R}) along with the inner product\nwe’ve defined forms an *inner product space*.\n\n## Orthogonality\n\nNow that we have an inner product, we can define orthogonality on\npolynomials: two polynomials p,q are *orthogonal* (w.r.t. our\ninner product) iff\n\n\\[\\langle p,q\\rangle=\\int\\_{-1}^{1}p(x)q(x)\\, dx=0\\]\n\nContrary to expectation [4], the monomial basis polynomials are *not*\northogonal using our definition of inner product.\n\nFor example, calculating the inner product for 1 and\nx^2:\n\n\\[\\langle 1,x^2\\rangle=\\int\\_{-1}^{1}x^2\\, dx=\\frac{x^3}{3}\\biggr|\\_{-1}^{1}=\\frac{2}{3}\\]\n\nThere are other sets of polynomials that *are* orthogonal using our\ninner product. For example, the Legendre\npolynomials; but\nthis is a topic for another post.\n\n---\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| [1] | There’s a level of basic algebra below which we won’t descend in these notes. We could break this statement further down by saying that something like a\\_i x^i + a\\_j x^j can be added to b\\_i x^i + b\\_j x^j by adding each power of x separately for any i and j, but let’s just take it for granted. |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| [2] | Obviously, this specific set of equations is quite trivial to solve without matrices; I just want to demonstrate the more general approach. Once we have a system of linear equations, the whole toolbox of linear algebra is at our disposal. For example, we could also have checked the determinant and seen it’s non-zero, which means that a square matrix is invertible, and in this case has a single solution of zeroes. |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| [3] | And actually with this (or any valid) inner product, P\\_n(\\mathbb{R}) indeed forms a Hilbert space, because it’s finite-dimensional, and every finite-dimensional inner product space is complete. |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| [4] | Because of how naturally this set spans P\\_n(\\mathbb{R}). And indeed, we can define alternative inner products using which monomials are orthogonal. |\n\n---\n\nFor comments, please send me\n an email.",

(Photo by Jonathan Hoefler)*\n\n***Note:** This is the first part of a two-article series. Also, it is not paywalled. Enjoy! — Paul*\n\n---\n\nThe photo above, taken about two and a half months ago, shows the entrance to Unity Temple, a Unitarian Universalist church in the Chicago suburb of Oak Park, Illinois. Designed by the renowned architect Frank Lloyd Wright (himself a lifelong Unitarian), it opened in 1908 and is sometimes referred to as the world’s first modern building. Wright later said that the Unity Temple project was when he stopped being an “architect of structure” and instead became an “architect of space.”\n\nDespite all of that, Unity Temple includes a surprising flaw. Can you spot it in that header photo?\n\nLet’s zoom in on a section of the bronze lettering above the doors:\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KZuG!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff020f87a-7847-4bad-9164-f0b5c00b66b0_1420x909.jpeg)\n\n*Rut-roh. (Photo by Jonathan Hoefler)*\n\nNow do you see the error? The “H” on the top line is upside-down! It’s particularly apparent because the crossbar of the “H” doesn’t align with the middle arm of the “E.” Compare that to the second line, where those two strokes *do* align. (If you look back at the header photo, you can see that the sign includes a third “H,” in the word “WORSHIP,” but that one is properly oriented.)\n\nIf this mistake sounds familiar, it’s because last summer I wrote about how the familiar blue “H” road signs indicating a nearby hospital are often upside-down. The person who alerted me to that “H”-driven phenomenon is the same one who spotted and photographed Unity Temple’s inverted “H”: my friend Jonathan Hoefler. He’s a famous typographer, so his radar is super-attuned to this stuff (plus his surname starts with an “H,” so he might be particularly sensitive to issues involving that letter). He let me know about the Unity Temple “H” after spotting it during a recent visit to Chicago.\n\nI asked Jonathan if he said anything to the Unity Temple staff about the upside-down letter. “I didn’t have the heart,” he said. “Also, what could be done?”\n\nThat might have been the end of the story. I imagined writing a short post that concluded with something like “Hey, even Frank Lloyd Wright made mistakes!”\n\nBut then Jonathan added this: “The audio tour at the temple mentioned that the exterior was sprayed with gunite in the 1970s, making me wonder if the original lettering was removed and reinstalled, either introducing the error or preserving it.”\n\nThat was an intriguing thought, so I figured I’d try to find out if the letters had been temporarily removed as part of the 1970s gunite treatment. That was the start of what eventually became a lengthy research and reporting process. Along the way, I turned up a bunch of relevant information, including the following:\n\n* Unity Temple has two separate entrances, one at the east and one at the west. Each entrance is adorned with identical metal lettering spelling out the same phrase: “For the Worship of God and the Service of Man.” (Jonathan’s photos are of the western entrance, and he didn’t realize there’s an identical sign on the eastern side. If he had known, he would have checked the eastern “H” situation.)\n* Both signs were indeed removed for the gunite treatment and then reinstalled, just as Jonathan suspected. That was in 1973.\n* Both signs were badly vandalized in the fall of 2010, when thieves stole 58 of the 72 original letters, apparently intending to sell them for scrap. The remaining 14 letters were removed and new lettering was installed over both entrances about 20 months later, in the spring of 2012.\n* The new lettering was taken down in 2014, when Unity Temple closed for a $25 million restoration. It reopened, with the lettering back in place, in mid-2017.\n\nThis information cast Jonathan’s observation in a different light, because it means Unity Temple’s lettering — which is rendered in a custom typeface that Wright designed — has gone through at least four distinct eras:\n\n**Era One** runs from the temple’s 1908 opening to the 1973 gunite treatment.\n\n**Era Two** runs from the 1973 gunite treatment to the 2010 lettering theft.\n\n**Era Three** runs from the 2012 installation of replacement lettering to the start of the 2014 restoration.\n\n**Era Four** runs from 2017, when the temple reopened after the restoration, to the present.\n\nMultiply each of the four eras by the three “H”s that appear in the slogan, and then again by the two separate entrances, and you have 24 distinct opportunities for an upside-down “H” to be installed! (And there could be even more eras, and thus more opportunities for inverted “H”s, if the letters were ever taken down and then reinstalled for some other reason that didn’t turn up in my research.)\n\nSo had the misoriented “H” that Jonathan recently spotted on the western sign been introduced as part of the recent restoration? Or maybe after the theft? Or maybe that “H” had been upside-down all along, and they just kept it that way with each reinstallation for the sake of consistency? Meanwhile, what about the lettering for the eastern entrance?\n\nAnd most intriguingly: Had Frank Lloyd Wright himself ever been responsible for an upside-down “H”? Wright died in 1959, so he had nothing to do with the most recent iterations of the lettering, but what about the earlier time periods?\n\nThis post is public so feel free to share it.\n\nShare\n\nMy hope was to answer those questions by creating a comprehensive visual timeline of the lettering over both entrances, so I ended up doing a lot of photo research. Recent-ish photos of the building are fairly easy to find, especially on Flickr (a godsend, because Flickr pics are date-tagged). But older images — basically, anything earlier than 2005 — were surprisingly difficult to source. I ended up having to engage quite a bit with what I’ve come to think of as the Frank Lloyd Wright industrial complex — a dense bureaucracy of foundations, libraries, museums, and research institutions that control access to anything Wright-related.\n\nWhile I didn’t achieve my original goal of producing a comprehensive visual record of the lettering, I did come up with a fair number of data points. Let’s start here:\n\n### Wright’s Original Conception\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Rs7y!,w_2400,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F78ac0bb2-89c8-4285-97b6-c8fb5924d3f3_9034x6173.jpeg)\n\n*(Image © The Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation, via Gunny Harboe Architects)*\n\nWright’s original drawings for Unity Temple, shown above, include depictions of the lettering. Let’s zoom in to get a closer look at the key area:\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!X88D!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F94e52826-5cfe-4b78-9ca7-88c281348348_1292x504.jpeg)\n\n*(Image © The Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation, via Gunny Harboe Architects)*\n\nThe drawing clearly shows that the crossbar of the “H” should be slightly north of the equator, so to speak, thus aligning with the center arm of the “E.” That’s not surprising, but it’s good to establish this as our baseline of Wright’s intent.\n\n### 1930s–1940s\n\nUnfortunately, I was not able to find any photos from Unity Temple’s 1908 opening, or even from its first few decades. The earliest archival photo I came up with is this one, which is frustratingly dated by the Oak Park Library as being from “1930s-40s”:\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4SWV!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2c18282f-5e24-49e5-9f60-27758c8e34ca_800x584.jpeg)\n\n*(Photo by Gilman Lane, Gilman Lane Photograph Collection, Ernest Hemingway Foundation of Oak Park Archives, Oak Park Public Library Special Collections, Oak Park, IL)*\n\nBased on the shadows, that is the eastern entrance. The lettering isn’t easy to make out, so let’s zoom in again:\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!henk!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5e0a4c93-7a09-4e13-bc29-ab7d9b2011c2_330x96.jpeg)\n\n*(Photo by Gilman Lane, Gilman Lane Photograph Collection, Ernest Hemingway Foundation of Oak Park Archives, Oak Park Public Library Special Collections, Oak Park, IL)*\n\nAlthough the image quality isn’t great, it’s good enough to confirm that each “H” is oriented correctly. For now, this is the earliest document we have.\n\n### May 1956\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!zrts!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd79ea6b2-5a50-43f0-b3f6-543cc496b919_2120x2789.jpeg)\n\n*(The Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation Archives)*\n\nThis is where things get interesting. The photo above, taken in May of 1956, shows the western entrance, and *all three* of the “H”sare upside-down! Again, let’s zoom in for a closer look:\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_kdT!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9780d0d5-290e-4ddf-8ef3-3e0829585c44_841x415.jpeg)\n\n*(The Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation Archives)*\n\nSo were these inverted “H”s at the western entrance *always* upside-down (which would mean Frank Lloyd Wright installed them that way), or were they originally positioned correctly and then got changed at some point? We can’t yet answer that question, because this 1956 photo is the earliest document we have of that entrance (at least for now).\n\n### 1956 to 1978\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8ZAT!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbaa4cb1c-90cf-4a16-9c1e-0a1cba591864_5998x7498.jpeg)\n\n*(HB-19311-P, Chicago History Museum, Hedrich-Blessing Collection)*\n\nThe photo above once again shows the western entrance, and there are two significant changes. The good news is that all of the “H”s are now properly orientated. To see the bad news, look at the “S” in “WORSHIP” — now *that* is upside-down! (The other “S,” in “SERVICE,” is properly oriented.)\n\nHere’s a closer look:\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!kedq!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F97521301-f354-49e6-9fc5-3789196ab63f_1920x894.jpeg)\n\n*(HB-19311-P, Chicago History Museum, Hedrich-Blessing Collection)*\n\nSo when was this photo taken? In another case of frustrating dating, the Chicago History Museum’s archive lists the date as “1956-1978.” Although we can’t know for sure, I’m thinking this image was probably taken after the 1973 gunite treatment, which would explain the letter orientation changes.\n\n### 2005 to 2010\n\nJumping ahead to the 2000s — shortly prior to the 2010 theft — Flickr photos show no changes to the western sign, which was still fully “H”-compliant and still had the upside-down “S.” Here are two representative examples, with the dates noted on each photo:\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!U2l5!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde73d5ca-d1d8-4ec3-933b-c493fd858983_2473x1633.jpeg)\n\n*(Photo by Flickr user Hideki Yoshida)*\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xv4g!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1b9f8fa3-3ddb-42e5-9315-2ddebe4e40a1_765x597.jpeg)\n\n*(Photo by Flickr user Rand McNally Pix)*\n\nPhotos of the eastern entrance from this period were harder to come by, in part because a tree was obscuring part of the sign. But in this 2007 shot, it appears that the “S” in “WORSHIP” is upside-down, as is the “H” on the second line (plus the “V” in “SERVICE” is missing, but that’s a separate issue):\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!lA8y!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7159fd14-911e-4f83-ba94-e41b03b9a50a_960x1069.jpeg)\n\n*(Photo by Flickr user wyliepoon)*\n\nThat last photo doesn’t show the “THE” in the top line. But the full slogan is visible in this 2008 shot:\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Dl7B!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F13c8fe55-ac1b-4cf3-8511-aca9d2209fab_1000x750.jpeg)\n\n*(Photo by Flickr user jtwex)*\n\nSo that confirms it: Shortly prior to the 2010 theft, the eastern sign had two upside-down letters — an “H” and an “S.”\n\n### The 2010 Theft\n\nVandals took most of the letters sometime during the night of September 28th, 2010. Here’s a photo showing how the denuded western entrance looked about nine and a half months later:\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!AOGI!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa412bc6c-ce4d-49fa-a627-cc53bd981345_774x551.jpeg)\n\n*(Photo by Flickr user JON6)*\n\nIf we zoom in, the ghosted letters seem to confirm that each “H” was properly oriented and that the “S” on the top line was not:\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-xN3!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61b9ed19-360c-4f87-a19d-0353f7f91573_233x73.jpeg)\n\n*(Photo by Flickr user JON6)*\n\nI was not able to find a corresponding photo for the eastern sign.\n\n### 2012 to 2014\n\nShiny new bronze lettering was unveiled in late May of 2012. How did it look? Let’s start with the western entrance:\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8pH4!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F75ed8ada-c37e-44bc-adb8-7d67ee60d34b_1452x1113.jpeg)\n\n*(Photo by Flickr user Alfi...",

    "content": "There's a particular kind of guilt that visits me when I open my feed reader after a few days away. It's not the guilt of having done something wrong, exactly. It's more like the feeling of walking into a room where people have been waiting for you, except when you look around, the room is empty. There's no one there. There never was.\n\nI've been thinking about this feeling for a long time. Longer than I probably should, given that it concerns something as mundane as reading articles on the internet. But I've come to believe that these small, repeated experiences shape us more than we like to admit.\n\nSo let me start with a question that's been nagging at me: *why do RSS readers look like email clients?*\n\nAll Items47\n\nDaring Fireball12\n\nPixel Envy8\n\nKottke15\n\nStratechery4\n\nHypercritical8\n\nThe App Store at 15\n\nDaring Fireball\n\nOn Taking Breaks\n\nPixel Envy\n\nThe Slow Web\n\nKottke\n\nAttention and Its Enemies\n\nStratechery\n\nDigital Minimalism\n\nHypercritical\n\nThe Case for RSS\n\nPixel Envy\n\nWhy I Quit Social Media\n\nKottke\n\nThe Slow Web\n\nKottke · 2 hours ago\n\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit.\n\n47 unread itemsUpdated 5 min ago\n\nThe shape is so ubiquitous it feels inevitable.\n\nIf you've used almost any RSS reader in the past two decades, you know this layout intimately. There's a sidebar with your feeds organized into folders. There's a list of items, sorted by date, with little dots indicating what you haven't read yet. There's a reading pane where the content appears when you click.\n\nThe shape is so ubiquitous that it feels inevitable. But of course nothing in design is inevitable. Someone made a choice, and then other people followed that choice, and eventually the choice calcified into convention.\n\nI know exactly who made that first choice,  \nbecause I asked.\n\nHis name is Brent Simmons. In 2002 he released NetNewsWire, the app that established the template nearly every RSS reader still follows today.\n\n\"I know the answer, or at least part of it. I wrote the first one of these. NetNewsWire Lite 1.0 was released in 2002, and it was the first RSS reader to resemble an email app.\"\n\n\"I was actually thinking about Usenet, not email, but whatever. The question I asked myself then was how would I design a Usenet app for (then-new) Mac OS X in the year 2002?\"\n\n\"The answer was pretty clear to me: instead of multiple windows, a single window with a sidebar, list of posts, and detail view.\"\n\nHe made a pragmatic decision, not an ideological one. RSS was unknown to most people in 2002. By using a familiar layout, something people already understood from email, he reduced the learning curve to almost nothing.\n\nIt worked. NetNewsWire took off. Google Reader took off. A thousand readers bloomed, and nearly all of them borrowed Brent's basic shape.\n\nBut here's what struck me about the end of his response:\n\n\"The part I don't understand and can't explain is why RSS readers are still mostly following this UI.\"\n\n\"But every new RSS reader ought to consider not being yet another three-paned-aggregator. There are surely millions of users who might prefer a river of news or other paradigms.\"\n\n\"Why not have some fun and do something new, or at least different?\"\n\nThe person who designed the original paradigm was asking, twenty-two years later, why everyone was still copying him.\n\nWhen you dress a new thing in old clothes, people don't just learn the shape. They inherit the feelings, the assumptions, the emotional weight. You can't borrow the layout of an inbox without also borrowing some of its psychology.\n\nEmail\n\nFrom: Mom\n\nFrom: Your boss\n\nFrom: Dr. Chen\n\nDid you get my message?\n\nFeeds\n\nFrom: A blog you like\n\nFrom: A newsletter\n\nFrom: A webcomic\n\nNothing happened. Nobody knows you're here.\n\nEmail's unread count means something specific: these are messages from real people who wrote to you and are, in some cases, actively waiting for your response. The number isn't neutral information. It's a measure of social debt.\n\nBut when we applied that same visual language to RSS (the unread counts, the bold text for new items, the sense of a backlog accumulating) we imported the anxiety without the cause.\n\nNobody is waiting.\n\nI've been trying to find the right name for this phenomenon, and I think I've finally landed on it:",

    "content": "Code, nerd culture and humor from Greg Knauss.\n\nLose Myself\n\nFeb\n24\n2026\n\nI don’t know what depression feels like for other people, but I can tell I’m headed down into the muck when my internal monologue turns against me. It’s got a handful of phrases that it repeats over and over when things start to go bad, and one favorite is “Nothing you do matters.”\n\nI’ve been getting that one a lot lately. I know, rationally, that it’s not true. A lot of what I do matters, to my family and my friends and myself. But, you know how it is: this is my mental illness; there are many like it, but this one is mine.\n\nWhy this particular phrase at this particular time stings so much is because it’s not entirely untrue, specifically with regard to my profession. I’m a computer programmer, see, and there has been a *lot* going on.\n\nAI.\n\nSigh.\n\nThey rhyme for a reason.\n\nI’m not talking about the the razor-sharp edge, where people eagerly bleed, running AI-based agents that free them from the burden of responding to e-mails from their friends. (Or people who were formerly their friends, given they don’t rate an actual response.)\n\nAnd I’m not talking about the churning, smoking, shambling software production stacks inspired by dystopian hellscapes. (The Mayor of Gas Town is literally named “The People Eater.” Little too on the nose there, pal.)\n\nAnd I’m not talking about the grand philosophical debates from our deepest thinkers and our best minds, if computers have risen to sentience, to consciousness. (Spoiler: No. Don’t be stupid. Jesus.)\n\nAnd I’m not even talking about the moral, ethical, social, environmental, or economic impact of AI, because nobody else is either. Boooring.\n\nWhat I am talking about is being replaced, about becoming expendable, about machines gaining the ability to adequately perform a very specific function that was previously the exclusive domain of skull meat.\n\nWhat I’m talking about is that nothing I do matters. That nothing I *can* do matters.\n\nIn just the past few months, what was wild-eyed science fiction is now workaday reality. I’ve been dubious about the prospects of LLMs creating code (and lots and lots of other things) for as long as they’ve existed, but it’s hard to argue with the latest wave and their abilities from a purely practical, purely capitalistic, purely ship-something-anything perspective — the perspective that pays the bills. I’ve seen self-professed non-technical people bring functioning code into being, and that bests a significant number of actual humans I’ve worked with.\n\nThe legend has John Henry — the very best in the world — winning his battle against a machine, only to lose the war by, y’know, dying. And I sure as hell ain’t no John Henry. How many steel-drivin’ men take one look at their new opponent and just walk away? How many are making the right decision by doing so?\n\nThere are a thousand factors at play here (most of which are still in motion) but for plenty of small-scale, snap-together projects, something like Anthropic’s Claude Code or OpenAI’s Codex will be good enough, for economically-viable values of both “good” and “enough.” They’ll either burp up scripts that simply wouldn’t exist otherwise, or do (some of) the work of (some) junior or mid-level coders (somewhat) faster and cheaper. But the direction things are headed seems pretty clear.\n\nIs the code any good? I don’t know. Who cares? Nobody looks at it anyway. AI produces a result, and results are what matter, and if you’re waiting for quality to factor significantly into that equation, I’ve got some bad news about the last 40 years of professional software development for you.\n\nThere are plenty of people I know — they’re not all professional programmers, but most are; people I respect and admire and envy — who have enthusiastically embraced this particular steam engine. Paul Ford wrote a wonderful essay about both his qualms and his excitement — Qualms: 4, Excitement: 6, final — and if what was being replaced wasn’t the basis for my definition of self, I might feel the same. I can ignore moral, ethical, social, environmental, and economic externalities just as well as the next guy.\n\nBut I *am* a programmer. Just like I’m a father and a husband and a son and a friend. It’s not something I *do*, it’s something that is fundamental to the core of my being. Like overly dramatic phrasing.\n\nI got into computers because solving puzzles was fun, and building worlds was fun, and making things — the *process* of making things — was fun, down at the granular level. It was nice to have something at the end, but the act of creation was the exciting part. I suspect that predilection will begin to disappear (in commercial environments, at the very least), now that the people who do it — who *want* who do it — can be replaced. The journey actually was the reward for some subset of weird little freaks, but you can now skip all that crap and just jump to the end and get on with it.\n\nPeople will argue that speaking English to LLMs is just another level of abstraction away from the physics of how the machine *actually* works. And while that’s technically true — the worst kind of true — it also misses the point. Industrialization fundamentally changes things, by quantum degrees. A Ding Dong from a factory is not the same thing as a *gâteau au chocolat et crème chantilly* from a baker which is not the same thing as cramming chunks of chocolate and scoops of whipped cream directly into your mouth while standing in front of the fridge at 2:00am. The level of care, of personalization, of intimacy — both given and taken — changes its nature. Digging a trench is a very different thing than telling someone to dig a trench. Assembling a clock is a very different thing than asking Siri for the time.\n\nI was lucky enough to have a trench-digging enthusiasm when it was economically advantageous to do so. I managed to pretty much exactly hit the window when deep-nerd brain chemistry could produce a viable, even lucrative, career. I am fortunate to be able to lean into an early senescence and walk (or be pushed) away, as what I want to do and what the world wants me to do diverge.\n\nIt still makes me sad, though, that what I’ve spent 45 years of my life toiling at will likely end up as a footnote, the providence of folksy artisans and historical reenactors. I didn’t leave a dent in the universe so much as splatted against it. The world no longer has a need for what I somewhat sardonically call my art. We are all product managers now, pleading with obtuse underlings to go back and try again and to get it right this time. I remain a father and husband and son and friend, but the need for what I can do — the need for what *programmers* can do — is shrinking, and my conception of myself and my usefulness along with it.\n\nThere will be more software than ever, as its production is automated; we are entering the industrial age of the digital age. But less of this code will be elegant, or considerate, or graceful. Less of it will be created by removing what isn’t David, and less of it will be driven by a human understanding of human needs.\n\nThat was something I did that mattered. I’ll miss it.\n\nText Version\n\nPrevious\n\nCleveland\n\nArchive\n\nHi there!

    "content": "![Daring Fireball](/graphics/logos/)\n\nBy **John Gruber**\n\n* Archive\n* The Talk Show\n* Dithering\n* Projects\n* Contact\n* Colophon\n* Feeds / Social\n* Sponsorship\n\n![Sentry](/martini/images/sentry-purple.png)\n\nSentry — Catch, trace,  \n and fix bugs across your entire stack.\n\n# My 2025 Apple Report Card\n\n###### Wednesday, 25 February 2026\n\nThis week Jason Snell published his annual Six Colors Apple Report Card for 2025. As I’ve done in the past — for the report-card years 2024, 2023, 2022, 2021, 2020, 2019, 2018 — I’m publishing my full remarks and grades here. On Snell’s report card, voters give per-category scores ranging from 5 to 1; I’ve translated these to letter grades, A to F, which is how I consider them. (See footnote 1 from last year’s report if you’re curious why it’s not A to E.)\n\nAs I noted last year, “Siri/Apple Intelligence” is not a standalone category on the report card. I know Snell is very much trying to keep the number of different categories from inflating, but AI has been the biggest thing in tech for several years running. If it were a standalone category, last year I said I’d have given Apple a D for 2024. This year, I’d have given them an F — an utter, very public failure. (Their AI efforts in 2025 did end on a mildly optimistic note — they cleaned house.)\n\n## Mac: C (last year: A)\n\nIf there were separate categories for Mac hardware and MacOS, I’d give the hardware an A and MacOS 26 Tahoe a D. The hardware continues to be great — fast, solid, reliable — and Apple Silicon continues to improve year-over-year with such predictability that Apple is making something very difficult look like it must be easy.\n\nTahoe, though, is the worst regression in the entire history of MacOS. There are many reasons to prefer MacOS to any of its competition — Windows or Linux — but the one that has been the most consistent since System 1 in 1984 is the superiority of its user interface. There is nothing about Tahoe’s new UI — the Mac’s implementation of the Liquid Glass concept Apple has applied across all its OSes — that is better than its predecessor, MacOS 15 Sequoia. Nothing. And there is much that is worse. Some of it much worse. Fundamental principles of human-computer interaction — principles that Apple itself forged over decades — have been completely ignored. And a lot of it just looks sloppy and amateur. Simple things like resizing windows, and having application icons that look like they were designed by talented artists.\n\n## iPhone: A (last year: A)\n\niPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max are, technically, the best iPhones Apple has ever made. They’re very well designed too. The change to make the camera plateau span the entire width of the phone is a good one. It looks better, allows a naked iPhone 17 Pro to sit more steadily on a flat surface, and lets one in a case sit on a surface without any wobble at all. Apple even finally added a really fun, bold color — “cosmic orange” — that, surprising no one, seems to be incredibly popular with customers.\n\nThe iPhone Air is, from a design perspective, the most amazing iPhone Apple has ever made. It’s a marvel to hold and carry. One rear-facing camera lens is limiting, but it’s an excellent camera. Not 17 Pro-quality, no, but excellent quality, yes. Battery life is amazing given the physical constraints of the iPhone Air’s thin and lightweight design. The main two dings against the iPhone Air are that (a) Apple didn’t offer it in a fun bold color like the 17 Pro’s orange, and (b) Apple, bafflingly, hasn’t advertised the Air. I’ve seen so little promotion of the Air that I’d wager most iPhone users in the market for a new phone don’t even know it exists until they walk into a store and see it there.\n\nThe no-adjective iPhone 17 is the best iPhone for most people, which is exactly what the no-adjective iPhone ought to be. Back in March, the iPhone 16e introduced both a terrific lowest-price new iPhone — including the then-current-generation A18 chip — and a significant shift in strategy from the SE models of yore. The SE iPhone models were only updated sporadically, going 2–4 years between revisions. The “16” in “16e” is a pretty strong hint that Apple now intends to update the e models annually, just like the rest of the iPhone lineup. People complain about the $600 starting price for the 16e, but that’s $200 lower than the no-adjective iPhone 17. If you’re in the market for a lower price than that, you’re in the market for a refurbished older iPhone.\n\niOS 26 is Apple’s best implementation of the Liquid Glass concept, by far. I prefer it, in just about every way, to iOS 18. There are some individual apps from Apple in iOS 26 that have poor implementations of Liquid Glass (Music, I’m looking in your direction) but most of them are decided improvements, with more consistency system-wide (like the placement of search fields).\n\n## iPad: B (last year: C)\n\niPad hardware continues to be fine, and “fine”, by iPad standards, means “the best tablets in the industry by far”. The lineup is well-differentiated and spans a larger than ever gamut, ranging from “totally casual user” to “actual pro usage”.\n\niPadOS 26 is the most exciting release of iPadOS ever. I don’t love all of it. I think the biggest problem is that too much complexity is exposed to very casual users, for whom the main appeal of using an iPad as their main “computer” is its rigorous simplicity. But the course reversal Apple has made for advanced users, from eschewing (often to the point of frustration, sometimes to the point of absurdity) the desktop GUI concept of overlapping windows, to embracing regular old-fashioned GUI windows, was the right call, and a welcome sign of humility.\n\nIt’s a new start for iPadOS, and I look forward to seeing where it goes. It’s been a long time since I’ve thought that about iPadOS.\n\n## Wearables Overall: B (last year: B)\n\nAirPods Pro 3 are frigging amazing. AirPods, overall, continue to exemplify Apple at its best.\n\n## Apple Watch: A (last year: C)\n\nApple Watch Series 11 and Ultra 3 are solid year-over-year improvements from the Department of If the Design Ain’t Broke Don’t Fix It. Battery life improvements, in particular, are impressive. No one comes close to Apple at making very small, powerful computers that don’t really seem like computers at all. And the best Apple Watch news of the year, by far in my opinion, is the SE 3. The SE 3 is simply an outstanding Apple Watch at very low prices ($249 for 40mm, $279 for 44mm). That’s the price range a *lot* of people are looking at if they’re thinking about getting themselves “a nice watch”, smart or not.\n\n## Vision Pro: C (last year: B)\n\nAn M5 speed-bump update to the Vision Pro was nice to see, but only as a sign that Apple is still committed to this new platform. And they’re actually starting to build a nice little library of immersive content that is extremely compelling — including baby steps toward immersive live sports with a limited slate of games, albeit just from one single NBA team (the Lakers). The new Personas in VisionOS 26 — effectively a version 2.0 of the feature — are amazing, and strikingly improved from the first implementation. That’s another sign that Apple is continuing to achieve groundbreaking things with this new platform, and the concept of spatial computing. But in terms of VisionOS being a productivity platform in its own right (not counting the excellent Mac Virtual Display app), I didn’t see any progress at all. Nor any outreach at all to third-party developers to make VisionOS into a serious productivity platform. Frankly, it’s weird — perhaps even alarming — that some of Apple’s own core apps like Calendar and Reminders are still iPad apps running in compatibility mode, not native VisionOS apps.\n\n## Home: D (last year: D)\n\nWhy isn’t this platform improving, in drastic groundbreaking ways, with any urgency? I really thought 2025 might be the year, but nope. I can’t think of any area where Apple’s attitude more clearly seems to be that “good enough” is good enough.\n\n## Apple TV: C (last year: C)\n\nSame grade, same comment as last year (just replacing the specific year with “[this year]”):\n\n> I’m a very happy daily (well, nightly) Apple TV user. But what\n> exactly improved or changed [this year]? Anything? It may well be fair\n> to say the current hardware — Apple TV 4K 3rd-gen, which shipped\n> in November 2022 — is fine, and this is a hardware platform that\n> only needs updates every 3 or 4 years, but we’re grading what\n> happened [this year].\n>\n> Also: I feel like Apple has never yet made a truly great remote\n> control for this platform. The current one is their best yet, but\n> it has obvious flaws.\n\nI fear complacency has set in. Apple TV 4K really is *so* much better than any competing set-top box (or built-in smart TV system), but it also still falls *so* far short of “insanely great”.\n\n## Services: B (last year: B)\n\nQuality is high, value is fair (except, still, for iCloud storage), and it’s getting to the point where it’s hard to keep up with all the great series on Apple TV.\n\n## Hardware Reliability: A (last year: A)\n\nNo news remains great news in this category.\n\n## Apple OS Quality: C (last year: B)\n\n## Apple Apps: B (last year: B)\n\nFor two straight years, I’ve written the same comment for this category: “I have concerns and complaints about aspects of the direction Apple’s software *design* is headed (or in some ways, has been now for years), but their software *reliability* has been very good for me.”\n\nThe reliability and technical quality remains excellent. While writing this report card, I checked, and my uptime on MacOS 15.7.2 got to 91 days before I got around to restarting, which I only did to upgrade to 15.7.3. At one point I literally had over 1,000 tabs open in Safari, spread across over 50 windows. (I have a problem with tab hoarding.) That is technical excellence.\n\nBut years-long growing concerns over the direction of Apple’s software *design* reached a breaking point with MacOS 26 Tahoe. It’s so bad — or at least, so much worse than MacOS 15 Sequoia — that I’m refusing to install it. That makes it hard to assign a single grade for “OS Quality”.\n\n## Developer Relations: D (last year: D)\n\nFifth year in a row with basically the same comment: Resentment over App Store policies continues to build. Frustrations with the App Store review process seem unresolved. Apple’s goal should be for developer relations to be so good that developers look for excuses to create software exclusively for Apple’s platforms. The opposite is happening.\n\n## Social and Societal Impact: F (last year: B)\n\nTim Cook is in an excruciatingly difficult position regarding the Trump 2.0 administration. But that’s his job. He’s clearly attempting to take the same tack he took with the Trump 1.0 administration from 2017–2020, which, in hindsight, he navigated with aplomb. To wit: staying above the fray, keeping Apple true to its institutional values while keeping it out of President Trump’s wrath.\n\nBut the Trump 2.0 administration isn’t anything like the 1.0 administration. Cook, addressing employee concerns back in 2016 regarding his participation in then-President-elect Trump’s “tech summit”, said, “There’s a large number of those issues, and the way that you advance them is to engage. Personally, I’ve never found being on the sideline a successful place to be.”\n\n“Awarding” Donald Trump a 24-karat gold trophy emblazoned with the Apple logo in August 2025 — after seeing eight months of Trump 2.0 in action — wasn’t “engagement” or “getting off the sideline”. It was obsequious complicity with a regime that is clearly destined for historical infamy. Cook’s continued strategy of “engagement” risks not only his personal legacy, but the reputation of the company itself.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Previous:** | Apple Releases iOS 26 Adoption Rates, and They’re Pretty Much in Line With the Last Few Years |\n\nDisplay Preferences",

Some of It Is No Longer “Chocolate.”\n\n## Even as cocoa prices fall, companies are learning a scary lesson: Americans don't notice when you give them fake chocolate.\n\nBy Jim Vorel  | \nFebruary 24, 2026 | 3:54pm\n\n*Photo via Unsplash, Tetiana Bykovets*\n**FoodSplinter\nChocolate**\n\n![](data:image/svg+xml,%3C%3Fxml version='1.0'%3F%3E%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 30 30' width='30px' height='30px'%3E%3Cpath d='M3,26c-0.552,0-1-0.447-1-1C2,23.395,2.485,9.553,19,9.016V5c0-0.404,0.244-0.77,0.617-0.924 c0.374-0.156,0.804-0.069,1.09,0.217l7,7c0.391,0.391,0.391,1.023,0,1.414l-7,7c-0.286,0.286-0.716,0.372-1.09,0.217 C19.244,19.77,19,19.404,19,19v-3.986c-6.12,0.171-10.631,1.924-13.083,5.098C4.022,22.563,4,24.976,4,25C4,25.553,3.552,26,3,26z' fill='%23a90026'/%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\nCopy to clipboard\n\n×\n* Copy Link\n* Facebook\n* Reddit\n* Bluesky\n\n0\n\n![Every Day, the Chocolate We Eat Gets Worse. Some of It Is No Longer “Chocolate.”](https://img.pastemagazine.com/wp-content/juploads/2026/02/chocolate-unsplash-main.jpg)\n\nFrom a consumer perspective, there are few things that portend a worse outcome than a company knowingly making its product worse in order to save a few bucks, and finding out that just as many customers *will still buy it anyway*. This scenario, in a nutshell (beanshell?) has been the dominant story in the world of chocolate for the last few years, with the enshittification of the entire segment the end result of crop failures and cocoa bean scarcity that sent the price of cocoa soaring to stratospheric heights in 2024 and 2025. More recently, those prices have steadily come back down to Earth, but guess what hasn’t changed back to how it was before? The chocolate. In fact, many of the world’s biggest sellers of chocolate-dependent treats are instead pushing forward on the embrace of cheaper replacements, increasingly convinced of the fact that consumers simply don’t know enough to notice or care. And they’re probably right.\n\nClimate change is of course largely to thank for the scarcity of cocoa beans that led prices in 2025 to peak at more than $10,000 per ton, almost five times what the price was in the summer of 2022. Unlike oddball, climate-adjacent stories such as an uptick in mushroom poisonings or a deadly rash of Japanese bear attacks, the climate vector in cocoa is far easier to understand at a glance. Longer droughts, extreme heat, unpredictable rainfall and insect-driven infection amplified by climate change have all played a part in decimating cocoa yields, with one nonprofit research group’s 2025 study finding that most of West Africa’s cocoa-growing regions now experience six additional weeks of extreme heat per year over the last decade. No doubt there are other factors as well, like the Donald Trump tariffs just struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court, but it doesn’t take any grasp of economics to understand why chocolate prices went through the roof.\n\n \n> Less chocolate in your chocolate: major manufacturers explore ways to cope with cocoa shortages due to upheaval and climate change. www.confectionerynews.com/Article/2026…\n>\n> (Note that one approach, alkalinizing the cocoa, undermines the antioxidant health benefits of chocolate.)\n>\n> [image or embed]\n>\n> — Honest Chocolates (@honestchocs.bsky.social) Jan 20, 2026 at 6:16 AM\n\n \n\nNaturally, this could only result in candy purveyors raising prices and passing that cost onto the consumer, or reformulating their product to make it more cheaply. And surprise, it’s the latter that has been widely employed by the likes of Mars, Ferrero, Lindt and especially The Hershey Company. None of them understandably want to jack up prices and reposition their wares as “luxury” items to sticker-shocked consumers who are already sensitive to inflation, and the alternative is fake chocolate.\n\n \n\nOr is it “fake”? It can be hard to know what exactly to call the substances that are now found coating many major candy bars such as Butterfinger, Baby Ruth, Almond Joy, Mr. Goodbar or Rolos. Food scientists refer to it as “compound chocolate” coating, because it’s made from actual cocoa powder, but replaces the more expensive source of fat (cocoa butter) with cheaper, lower-quality vegetable fats. When Hershey brands such as Mr. Goodbar or Almond Joy made the switch in recent years, their labels subtly changed from claiming that they were “milk chocolate,” to “chocolate candy,” which strikes me as particularly insidious phrasing. A more obvious indicator is another word that many companies use: “Chocolatey” coating. Wondering how much this scourge had infiltrated my own home, I took a look moments ago at several packages of Girl Scout Cookies, only to find the inevitable: Both my Thin Mints and Peanut Butter Patties are also made with compound chocolate, rather than the real thing. I can hardly pretend to be surprised. Even in candies that continue to use real chocolate, meanwhile, cost-cutting measures have sometimes been employed, such as the milk chocolate coating of a Snickers bar becoming slightly thinner over time. Some products even mix real chocolate and compound chocolate in a single cookie or candy.\n\n![](https://img.pastemagazine.com/wp-content/juploads/2026/02/MixCollage-24-Feb-2026-03-15-PM-8004.jpg) Before: “Milk chocolate.” After: “Chocolate candy.”\n\nBut wait, it gets worse! Not content to merely replace one key element of chocolate, food scientists and entrepreneurs have teamed up to create products such as “a chocolate that’s made without cocoa using AI technology to reverse-engineer the recipe.” I was just thinking that we really needed to get AI involved in there somewhere. This company, NotCo, specializes in an entire range of plant-based fake foods, with CEO Matias Muchnick raving to *Today* at the end of 2025 that “we have trained an algorithm to replicate exactly the favorite chocolate that you always loved,” sounding not at all like an ancient creature that preys on human hopes and dreams. Said fake chocolate, if you were wondering, is ultimately assembled from ingredients that include carob, shea butter and malt extract, with the savvy entrepreneur saying that it could save manufacturers in the ballpark of 30%. Check out the grandiosity of this gloating quote: “I think we have a high chance of being the ones that actually saved chocolate for the rest of humanity.” Wow, “saving chocolate” by destroying it. Talk about your world-class achievements in CEO douchebaggery.\n\n \n\nReal chocolate, meanwhile, seems to have few allies in the face of corporate greed, although even real chocolate is still plagued by the problem of child and slave labor despite assurances from the candy world’s megacorps that they would fight the practice. Still, considering their focus on “real food,” you might think this would be the kind of cause that the MAHA movement could actually get behind, but in this case their deeply impractical attitude toward sugar probably eschews even ethical chocolate advocacy. Antioxidant-rich dark chocolate doesn’t even really fit in the MAHA mindset, given that RFK Jr.’s new dietary guidelines explicitly tell parents that they should withhold any food with added sugars from children until after the age of 10, presumably raising an entire generation of eating disordered kids in the process. I wouldn’t expect any help from a Health and Human Services Secretary that spends decades criticizing and prosecuting cases against a herbicide, only to instantaneously flip sides and embrace it after Donald Trump tells him to do so.\n\n> The grandson of the inventor of Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups is lashing out at The Hershey Co., accusing the candy company of hurting the Reese’s brand by shifting to cheaper ingredients in many products.\n>\n> [image or embed]\n>\n> — The Associated Press (@apnews.com) Feb 19, 2026 at 5:00 PM\n\n \n\nThe more naive among us would likely hope that as cocoa prices continue to decrease and normalize, that major manufacturers would quietly reformulate their products again, this time to bring some legitimacy *back* to them, but this is wishful thinking. Prices may be normalizing, but the root causes of climate change aren’t going away, and the problems they pose to daily life on our planet only become more pronounced. In the U.S., farmers are struggling to grow the staple crops our American diet expects, and even the food we do grow is actually becoming less nutritious over time. Cocoa growers in West Africa continue to face conditions that are borderline intolerable, and so the likes of The Hershey Co. continue to press onward, slowly extending fake chocolate into new flagships, wary of the possibility of consumer blowback. Just this week, Brad Reese, grandson of the inventor of the Reese’s Peanut Butter Cup, lashed out at The Hershey Company for using compounded chocolate and “peanut butter creme” instead of real milk chocolate and peanut butter in limited time offerings like Reese’s Valentine’s Day hearts and Easter eggs, no doubt monitoring consumer feedback to see if they can extend the same penny-pinching into the flagship peanut butter cups. “I felt embarrassed to even wear anything that says Reese’s on it,” he said.\n\nThe irony is of course that at the end of the day, it’s the multinational corporations that are more acutely aware than any of us of the effects of climate change, because they can feel those effects in their pocketbooks. And they sure as hell are overjoyed when they change a product, stripping out real chocolate for a cheaper substitute, and find that just as many people are still willing to buy the latest step in our culture-wide enshittification.\n\nOn an earnings call last year, Hershey CFO Steve Voskuil was asked about how reformulations could affect sales or the company’s image. His reply says it all: “It’s a place we look at, we test, and in some parts of our portfolio, over time we’ve made some changes. There’s been no consumer impact whatsoever.”\n\nJoin the discussion...\n\n![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![](https://img.pastemagazine.com/wp-content/shared-images/chevron-down-bold-cropped-j.svg) Keep scrolling for more great stories.![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![](https://img.pastemagazine.com/wp-content/shared-images/chevron-down-bold-cropped-j.svg)",

So, I’ve been trying to engage with more conversations out in the world, in hopes of communicating some of the ideas that might not get shared from more traditional voices in technology. These recent conversations have been pretty well received, and I hope you’ll take a minute to give them a listen when you have a moment.\n\n## Galaxy Brain\n\nFirst, it was nice to sit down with Charlie Warzel, as he invited me to speak with him on Galaxy Brain (full transcript at that link), his excellent podcast for The Atlantic. The initial topic was some of the alarmist hype being raised around AI within the tech industry right now, but we had a much more far-ranging conversation, and I was particularly glad that I got to articulate my (somewhat nuanced) take on the rhetoric that many of the Big AI companies push about their LLM products being “inevitable”.\n\nIn short, while I think it’s important to fight their narrative that treats big commercial AI products as inevitable, I don’t think it will be effective or successful to do so by trying to stop regular people from using LLMs at all. Instead, I think we have to pursue a third option, which is a multiplicity of small, independent, accountable and purpose-built LLMs. By analogy, the answer to unhealthy fast food is good, home-cooked meals and neighborhood restaurants all using local ingredients.\n\nThe full conversation is almost 45 minutes, but I’ve cued up the section on inevitability here:\n\n## Revolution Social\n\nNext up, I got to reconnect with Rabble, whom I’ve known since the earliest days of social media, for his podcast Revolution.Social. The framing for this episode was “Silicon Valley has lost its moral compass” (did it have one? Ayyyyy) but this was another chance to have a wide-ranging conversation, and I was particularly glad to get into the reckoning that I think is coming around intellectual property in the AI era. Put simply, I think that the current practice of wholesale appropriation of content from creators without consent or compensation by the AI companies is simply untenable. If nothing else, as normal companies start using data and content, they’re going to *want* to pay for it just so they don’t get sued and so that the quality of the content they’re using is of a known reliability. That will start to change things from he current Wild West “steal all the stuff and sort it out later” mentality.\n It will not surprise you to find out that I illustrated this point by using examples that included… Prince and Taylor Swift. But there’s lots of other good stuff in the conversation too! Let me know what you think.\n\n## What’s next?\n\nAs I’ve been writing more here on my site again, many of these topics seem to have resonated, and there have been some more opportunities to guest on podcasts, or invitations to speak at various events. For the last several years, I had largely declined all such invitations, both out of some fatigue over where the industry was at, and also because I didn’t think I had anything in particular to say.\n\nIn all honesty, these days it feels like the stakes are too high, and there are too few people who are addressing some of these issues, so I changed my mind and started to re-engage. I may well be an imperfect messenger, and I would eagerly pass the microphone to others who want to use their voices to talk about how tech can be more accountable and more humanist (if that’s you, let me know!). But if you think there’s value to these kinds of things, let me know, or if you think there are places where I should be getting the message out, do let them know, and I’ll try to do my best to dedicate as much time and energy as I can to doing so. And, as always, if there’s something I could be doing better in communicating in these kinds of platforms, your critique and comments are always welcome!",

    "content": "**I have a problem:** Unlike most people, I actually read my spam folder on a regular basis. (Often, they’re some of the most interesting emails I get.) I find spam to be intriguing, interesting, and often highlighting some modern trends.\n\nAnd sometimes, it surfaces something I actually care about that missed my other folders, like an upcoming interview I’m excited to share with all of you.\n\nBut one thing about spam that has been true across the board is that it’s ugly. Really, really ugly. Often, what will happen with spam is that they’ll get your email address through questionable means, say a leak of your information in an exploit, and flood your inbox with some of the worst crap you’ve ever seen.\n\nBut recently, some of these clearly trash emails have gotten a design upgrade:\n\n![spam-screenshot.png](https://proxy.tedium.co/8h8Tl1FX4qpZZt9wBeq9oMiKykY=/710x908/filters:quality(80)/uploads/spam-screenshot.png)\n\nA spam email informing me that my fake cloud storage platform is full.\n\nThat is a relatively attractive spam email, trying to sell me on a scam. It is obviously the work of one Claude A. Fakeguy.\n\nIt has that swing. Other, less attractive spam emails also have this swing, such as this one:\n\n![UglySpam.png](https://proxy.tedium.co/1nFXH1sAgtbCETqZRVxT3TZicMc=/742x1109/filters:quality(80)/uploads/UglySpam.png)\n\nA less attractive email informing me of upcoming video game addiction litigation. How did they know!?!?\n\nBut what I think the real tell is that these emails hang together when you have images off, which they did not in the past. This is a problem, because in your spam folder, images are automatically turned off.\n\nHence why this email warning me that my antivirus plus renewal failed now looks like this:\n\n![Warning.png](https://proxy.tedium.co/Q5zsFE7Kg4Cr61hjrYd8euBV-Ew=/628x901/filters:quality(80)/uploads/Warning.png)\n\nOh no, what will I do on my Linux computer that doesn’t support your antivirus program?\n\nThis is a funny, if troubling element in the history of spam—and probably a spot of bad news for people who use vibe coding to actually make real things.\n\n![… You?](https://static.tedium.co/uploads/kofi_logo.png)\n\n##### Sponsored By … You?\n\n**If you find weird or unusual topics** like this super-fascinating, the best way to tell us is to **give us a nod on Ko-Fi**. It helps ensure that we can keep this machine moving, support outside writers, and bring on the tools to support our writing. (Also it’s heartening when someone chips in.)\n\nWe accept advertising, too!

And that’s bad news as we attempt to protect ourselves from the crap hiding in our inbox. We’re likely to trust less and accidentally give away more. And untrustworthy figures who don’t know how to code are more likely to throw more crap our way.\n\nThis is a point Anthropic itself pointed out in one of its own reports from last summer, about “no-code” ransomware that can be built by people incapable of actually building ransomware without the help of an LLM.\n\nDespite this, these people can create commercial malware programs that they can sell for up to $1,200 a pop.\n\nThe security platform Guard.io makes clear that platforms like Lovable are going to enable a new class of criminal:\n\n> Just like with “Vibe-coding”, creating scamming schemes these days requires almost no prior technical skills. All a junior scammer needs is an idea and access to a free AI agent. Want to steal credit card details? No problem. Target a company’s employees and steal their Office365 credentials? Easy. A few prompts, and you’re off. The bar has never been lower, and the potential impact has never been more significant. That’s what we call VibeScamming.\n\nAnd, for people who vibe code, the real problem is that, long-term, their stuff is going to look very untrustworthy because of the specific mix of chrome, color, and emojis that vibe-coded applications specialize in.\n\nThe thing that ultimately makes something look human is the addition of actual design and human flair. I encourage you to actually put a little humanness into what you build if you’re going to do it and share it with the world.\n\n### How to spot a vibe-coded faker\n\n**But for many,** it is going to be harder than ever to tell what’s real and what’s fake. Which means you should probably go out of your way to use techniques like email obfuscation and email aliases to protect yourself. (It makes it easier to tell which bread-baking forum violated your trust, for one thing.)\n\nOn the plus side, there are still tells. A key one is if they refer to you by not your name, but the name of your email address. Another is the from address, which is often some highly obfuscated bit of junk designed to evade detection.\n\nThe one that made me laugh recently was when I got really crappy spam emails on an address that has never gotten them for the first time, promoting traditional spam topics with a Claudecore flair. They seemed random, but were extremely easy to get rid of, because they were all emailed from a bare Firebase domain, meaning that I could remove them with the help of a single filter.\n\nJust because spam emails are more attractive now doesn’t mean the people making them aren’t still extremely stupid.\n\n##### Spam-Free Links\n\n**A quick shout-out** to the only tool that makes my inbox bearable in 2026, Simplify Gmail.\n\n**Oh good, there’s a new web browser** for PowerPC Macs in 2026, and per my pal Action Retro, it’s quite good!\n\n**Speaking of inboxes,** this story of an AI safety exec letting an AI tool delete her inbox is so darkly funny that I’m surprised it’s real.\n\n--\n\nFind this one an interesting read?
